    EXAMPLES

    Verbs: GET=find, POST=create, PUT=store (create or update), PATCH=update, DELETE=delete

    By short-alias:
    NOTE: "am9obi5kb2U6bW9xdWk=" is the Base64 encoded String "john.doe:moqui"

    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Basic am9obi5kb2U6bW9xdWk=" http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples/TEST2
    curl -X GET -u john.doe:moqui http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples/TEST2

    By entity name:

    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Basic am9obi5kb2U6bW9xdWk=" http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/Example/TEST2

    Detail/child records can be retrieved in various ways, in the first "items" is a short-alias on the relationship:

    curl -X GET -u john.doe:moqui http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples/TEST2/items/01
    curl -X GET -u john.doe:moqui http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/exampleItems/TEST2/01

    To get a record plus all dependents in the JSON document use dependents=true:

    curl -X GET -u john.doe:moqui -i http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples/TEST2?dependents=true

    Parameters can also be used for searching, which supports the per-field extensions (_op, _ic, etc) of
        EntityFind.searchFormInputs(), the orderByField parameter for comma-separated fields to sort the results by,
        and pageIndex, pageSize for pagination; parameters can be in the URL (preferred) or in request body as JSON.
    The number of records will be limited to 100 unless a different pageSize is specified. The total count of records
        is returned in the X-Total-Count HTTP response header. To facilitate pagination also calculates and adds headers
        for the same fields Moqui uses for pagination: X-Page-Index, X-Page-Size, X-Page-Max-Index, X-Page-Range-Low,
        and X-Page-Range-High.

    curl -X GET -u john.doe:moqui -i http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples
    curl -X GET -u john.doe:moqui -i 'http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples?exampleName=test&exampleName_op=contains&exampleName_ic=Y&orderByField=exampleName&pageIndex=0'

    Create looks like (note the two approaches for authc):

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u john.doe:moqui \
         -d '{ "exampleName":"REST Test 1", "exampleTypeEnumId":"EXT_MADE_UP", "statusId":"EXST_IN_DESIGN" }' \
            http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{ "exampleName":"REST Test 1", "exampleTypeEnumId":"EXT_MADE_UP", "statusId":"EXST_IN_DESIGN", \
             "authUsername":"john.doe", "authPassword":"moqui" }' http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples

    Store looks like (PATCH is similar):

    curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u john.doe:moqui \
         -d '{ "exampleName":"REST Test - Rev 2" }' http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples/TEST2

    Delete looks like:

    curl -X DELETE -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u john.doe:moqui \
         http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples/100010

    This can also be used for bulk operations by passing a JSON document that is a list/array of map/object instead of a
        single map/object. The operation will be done for each entry in the list/array and the result will be a JSON
        document with a list/array with the result for each of the passed entries (generally a map/object, may be empty).
    For example, to create multiple items (ExampleItem) for an Example, with an auto-generated secondary sequence ID
        (exampleItemSeqId) use something like:

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u john.doe:moqui \
         -d '[{ "description":"New REST Item 1", "amount":100 }, { "description":"New REST Item 2", "amount":200 }]' \
            http://localhost:8080/rest/v1/examples/TEST2/items
