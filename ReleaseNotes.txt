Moqui Framework Release Notes

===========================================================================
Release 1.0.2 - Date Not Yet Decided
===========================================================================

Version 1.0.2 ... TODO

This release includes:

- Support for nested parameter elements in service definitions for
  Map and Node (groovy.util.Node) parameters; the main reason for Node
  support is for XML messages coming in such as the OAGIS ones to be
  handled directly by a service (this is one part of Mantle)
- Methods on ArtifactExecutionFacade and options on the authenticate
  attribute on the service definition and the require-authentication on the
  screen definition to make the current artifact anonymously authorized

Bug Fixes:


===========================================================================
Release 1.0.1 - 31 December 2011
===========================================================================

Version 1.0.1 is primarily a maintenance and bug fix release. The few new
features are mostly extensions to existing features for improved
flexibility, to round out functionality, and better support standards.

This release includes:

- All the great features of the 1.0.0 and previous releases
- Updated Gradle build file for version 1.0-milestone-6 (previously ran on
  1.0-milestone-3)
- Added support to automatically clear caches for view-entity based in
  updates to member-entity records, as long as all member-entity PK fields
  are directly or indirectly aliased on the view-entity
- Improved entity-auto service error handling
- Changed login screen to render in the same request instead of a redirect
  and to return a status code of 401 (related to bug #3442045)
- Made form field sub-fields more flexible, can include any widget tag
  under them now; this has been tested with render-mode and should work
  with others as they just run the corresponding macro for the widget
  element, but your mileage may vary
- Added support for a classes directory under the runtime directory, and
  under each component directory to go along with the lib directories so
  that classpath resources do not have to be in a jar file
- Added support for JSR-223 (javax.script) compatible scripting languages
  through configuration only (in moqui-conf file) so no ScriptRunner
  interface implementation is needed for these
- Added support for JavaScript (.js) server-side scripts through
  javax.script interface
- Added support for StartTLS and SSL to sendEmailTemplate service, based
  on the configuration in the EmailServer record

Bug Fixes:

- Removed emailTypeEnumId from the PK of the EmailMessage entity, it
  should not have been there and is not needed (or wanted); this PK
  change will require modifying or rebuilding that table in existing
  systems
- Fixed issue with handling entities in different packages that have the
  same name
- Instead of submit buttons always having name=submit, they now use the
  name of the XML Form field; to see if one button or another was pressed
  just check to see if the parameter was passed; also changed all submit
  field names to submitButton to avoid conflict with standard DOM function
  "submit" for form elements (thanks to Vasanth for reporting this)
- Fixed bad reference to ComparisonOperator in DateCondition class
- Fixed issue with settings nulls in an entity-auto update service or
  anywhere the dbValueMap is not populated from the database
- Fixed bug (#3442014) with funny FTL eval of label.@encode attribute
- Fixed issue with ResourceFacade classpath:// URLs that were not using
  thread's context ClassLoader, and so weren't finding classpath entries
  in runtime or component lib and classes directories
- Fixed issue with ResourceReference, TemplateRenderer, ScriptRunner,
  ServiceRunner, and Java service implementation class loading to use the
  current Thread's context ClassLoader which will get the component and
  runtime lib and classes resources
- Fixed issue where automatic reverse relationship did not work for full
  entity names
- Fixed issue with findRelated and findRelatedOne when forUpdate is null
- Fixed bug in StupidUtilities.basicConvert so that String to Boolean
  conversions do not use the default groovy non-empty rule for true, ie
  so that the string "false" will actually evaluate to false
- Fixed service parameters validation to not treat false boolean values as
  empty values (ie we can't use groovy non-empty definition for Booleans)
- Fixed permission issue in resetPassword service


===========================================================================
Release 1.0.0 - 21 November 2011
===========================================================================

Here it is, the initial production release of the 1.0 series. This release
includes various fixes and new features to facilitate easy use based on
more extensive testing and real-world development using the framework.

More examples of different patterns exist in Moqui Framework itself, as
well as in add-on projects including Mantle, POP Commerce, and so on.

This release includes:

- All the great features of the preview, beta and rc1 releases
- For field name pattern consistency changed GeoAssoc.geoIdTo to toGeoId,
  StatusValidChange.statusIdTo to toStatusId, and UomConversion.uomIdTo to
  toUomId
- Added support to skip stats tracking based on a conditional expression
- More performance profiling and improvements
  - entity-auto update and delete services no longer do a find first
  - various frequently used objects are cached in UserFacade, especially
    those used for authz and tarpit, making many things faster and cached
    queries around 4 times faster than the already optimized speed
  - many small performance improvements, changes to get around Groovy and
    Java quirks
- Change components to load in reverse of order initialized (later
  components override earlier ones)
- Increased text field sizes (short to 63, medium to 255, long to 4095)
- Changed a bunch of fields from text-long to text-medium that are either
  primary-key fields, or that don't need to be so long, or in entities
  where there are too many text-long fields
- User Facade
  - Added support for login via HTTP Basic Authorization, mostly for
    things like RESTful services and support for clients using it
- Entity Facade
  - Allow (optional) reference of entity by package-name + entity-name,
  - Change framework to reference all its entities by fully qualified name
  - Allow separator (hash) between title and related-entity-name in
    relationship name now that related-entity-name may be packages and
    such, and looks funny
  - Primary sequenced ID banking for better performance when creating
    records with sequenced single field primary key (default bank size 50)
  - Change lastUpdatedStamp to tx timestamp to sync/export/etc data without
    splitting transactions
  - Supports seed-data element in entity and extend-entity elements so
    that seed data can be defined and managed along with entity definitions
  - Option to disable Entity ECAs during data load
  - Isolate cache clearing failures, don't ever kill calling method (ie
    never throw an exception/throwable)
- Screen Facade
  - Filter menu rendering by authorization
  - List multi form submit button below and not in own column
  - Allow field, auto-fields-entity, and auto-fields-service to appear in
    any order and preserve that order when exploding the form definition
  - Auto Screen move Edit button on list forms to left side
  - If form transition has a single service (service-call instead of
    actions elements) then automatically use that service for validation
    information for fields with matching name
  - Improved handling of context and error parameters to more cleanly and
    easily repopulate forms after a server-side error
  - Example (/echopath) of handling "path info" beyond screen or transition
    in request path
- Added support for other types of wiki files including MediaWiki, Textile,
  TracWiki, and TWiki (in addition to Confluence)

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-rc1 - 3 August 2011
===========================================================================

The first 1.0 release candidate of the Moqui Framework (version 1.0-rc1)
was released on 3 August 2011.

This release includes various small new features based on feedback and
actual use, including Apache Shiro for security (authc and authz), build
using Gradle which supports Maven repositories and with directory layout
changed to follow Maven conventions, the ability to run arbitrary SQL and
get the results back in an EntityListIterator, and the Data View tool that
allows users to build queries and data exports on the fly.

This release candidate also includes improvements based on more testing,
including performance testing and profiling to dramatically increase the
speed of various operations, especially those done frequently.

As a release candidate from this point only minor changes are expected
before the 1.0 final production-ready release.

This release includes:

- All the great features of the preview releases, 1.0-beta1, and 1.0-beta2

  including better automatic foreign key names, looking for a "mantle"
  directory under the runtime directory where the mantle components can go
  (can actually have the GIT checkout of mantle right there)
- Added a UserGroup (ALL_USERS) that all users are automatically members of
- Security: tightened permissions, using the entity.@authorize-skip much
  less by adding disable/enableAuthz calls to framework code, and adding an
  authorization for users to view their own UserAccount record.
- Directory structure and build changes to simplify and be more consistent
  with de-facto standards from Maven/Gradle/etc
- Small changes to make it easier to include the runtime directory inside
  the deployed war file.
- Resource Facade
  - Added ScriptRunner interface to allow for easily adding scripting
    languages to be supported by the ResourceFacade

    moqui.security.ArtifactTarpit in ExampleSecurityData.xml)
  - Support authorization checks through Shiro realm
- Tools Screens
  - Auto Screen
    - Order by links in column headers by default (by default for all
      auto fields entity as well)

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-beta2 - 30 May 2011
===========================================================================

The 1.0-beta2 release includes a number of new tools, most notably the Auto
Screen UI that creates a user interface based on entity and relationship
definitions for master entities, and tabs for the detail and associated
entities of each. This release also includes a number of smaller new
features and bug fixes found while building a variety of functionality
with Moqui Framework. One notable example of that is automatic or explicit
alternate screen selection based on the HTTP request User-Agent header, and
there is an example of alternate screens for the iPad.

Overall release 1.0-beta2 is more robust, functional, and reliable than the
previous release.

This release includes:

- All the great features of releases 1.0-preview1 to 1.0-beta1
- Changed so that web.requestParameters Map is automatically added to the
  context when it is initialized for the web (helps reduce dependency in
  code on web-specific stuff, ie ec.web.requestParameter references)
- L10nFacade: moved number and date/time parsing and formatting methods
  from UserFacade to L10nFacade
- TransactionFacade: changed suspend() and resume() methods to better use
  internal stack of suspended transactions for consistency and a simpler
  API; also added stack of Exception to track where transactions are
  suspended for easier finding of lock wait timeout types of errors
- Moved MoquiDefaultConf.xml from framework/api to framework/impl since it
  contains a lot of implementation-specific configuration
- Updated Atomikos TransactionsEssentials to 3.7.0 and ehcache to 2.4.1
- Support <component>/lib and runtime/lib jar loading in a cached and
  extended/extensible ClassLoader
- Screen transition now supports restriction by HTTP request method
- Trim stack traces to not include Groovy proxy/etc calls (Sam's idea);
  implemented for now in BaseException, will use in other areas over time
- Changed Example entities and seed data to follow pattern to be used in
  Moqui and Mantle where the relationship.title is the enumTypeId or the
  statusTypeId
- XML Screens
  - Dynamic transition name handling (support regex transition names)
  - Specify macro template in screen def to override default in moqui-conf
  - Template for xsl-fo render mode
  - Added support for drop-down.entity-options in Screen Form
  - Auto create drop-downs for fields with a relationship to Enumeration
    using relationship.title as the enumTypeId, check to see if is valid
    enumTypeId before creating drop-down
  - Auto create drop-downs for fields with a type one relationship, with
    limit of 200 to avoid crazy drop-downs
  - Choose default subscreen (override by path) based on user agent or
    other condition (using any data available in the ec)
  - Override login path in screen (use value from deepest screen in path)
- Resource Facade
  - Method for FOP transform to PDF, etc
  - Support .gstring templates (groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Templates)
- Entity Facade
  - More intelligent group by fields, ie add all fields in view-entity and
    DynamicViewEntity to group by list if they don't have a function; with
    support for this get rid of alias.@group-by attribute, not needed when
    done automatically
  - Entity Master data export (master record and all dependent records)
  - Entity and Dependents export: if an entity is a dependent of another,
    and of the master then export it after the other entity it is a
    dependent of
- Tools Screens
  - Auto Screen
    - Master Entity List (entities with dependents)
    - AutoFind Screen (find, create, delete master entity records)

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-beta1 - 01 Apr 2011
===========================================================================

The 1.0-beta1 release is the first feature-complete release for the 1.0
series. Various tools screens that may be included in the 1.0-final release
are not yet complete, but the framework itself is feature-complete.
Following this release the focus for the framework shifts from
implementation to testing and to building applications and tools based on
it (in Moqui Framework, Moqui Mantle, and in other Moqui-based projects).

This release includes:

- All the great features of releases 1.0-preview1 to 1.0-preview3

  - Incoming email handling with Email ECA Rules (emeca) with the
    org.moqui.impl.EmailServices.pollEmailServer service, configured with
    the EmailServer entity
  - Service (org.moqui.impl.EmailServices.sendEmailTemplate) to send email
    based on settings in the EmailTemplate entity
- Entity Facade
  - Automatic reverse-many relationship for type one relationships coming
    the other way (done on-demand at run-time)
- Password reset email and forgot password form
- Some fixes so that Moqui will run in Java on Windows
- Testing and fixes for EntityFindImpl.count();
  screen.transition.*-response parameters; screen.transition with no
  actions or conditional responses to act as an alias, even with
  parameters/etc; script type services; updatePassword service and various
  security/password settings

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-preview3 - 19 Mar 2011
===========================================================================

Moqui 1.0-preview3 introduces various features to automatically and easily
make the applications you build using the previously available tools easier
to deploy and administer, and easier to test and get information about what
is happening as artifacts are executed. These include multi-tenant support,
artifact hit and hit bin tracking (for screens, transitions, services, and
entities), database-driven artifact authorization with many advanced
options, XML-RPC and JSON-RPC calls for Moqui services, and Tools screens
to administer and get information about various parts of the framework.

NOTE: just before this release the official code repository for Moqui moved
from SourceForge SVN to Git on GitHub so that users can more easily create
Git forks for their own use, and to allows pulls from their Git forks back
into the main Moqui repository. The Moqui GitHub URL is:

https://github.com/jonesde/moqui

This release includes:

- All of the great features of 1.0-preview1 and 1.0-preview2
- Updated various libraries included (esp Groovy, ehCache, Quartz)

- JSON-RPC 2.0 outgoing service runner (with Dzhuvinov JSON-RPC)
- XML-RPC incoming service handler (with Redstone XML-RPC)
- XML-RPC outgoing service runner (with Redstone XML-RPC)
- XML Screens
  - Screen form client JS validation based on target transition service
    definition (define once, run on client and server); using jquery
    validation (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation); so far for
    required, number-integer, number-decimal, text-email, text-url,
    text-digits, credit-card; try out on the Edit Example screen
  - Screen form-list multi=false support (one form per row)
  - Screen form-list multi=true support, service call multi=true
  - Screen form-list support form-links inside main form
  - Screen form auto-complete for text-line
  - Screen subscreen menu dynamic tabs (last level only) that loads
    content as a standalone screen from the server with an ajax call
  - Screen form focus-field, skip-start and skip-end supported

  transition, service and entity (bin only)
- User preference handling
- Artifact Execution Facade
  - ArtifactExecutionFacade for artifact stack tracking
  - Artifact Authorization based on configuration in db
  - Call ArtifactExecutionFacade.push(aei) (to track, check authz, etc) for
    screen, transition, service, entity
  - Disable authz on data loading; command line and assumed to be safe
  - Handle direct service/entity calls, ArtifactGroupMember with pattern
  - Review and test to determine which entities can skip authz for view
    and create (ie some view only, some create only, some view and create)
  - For entity-implicit service calls just look for entity authz
  - Support authorization on subscreens even if no authz on parent
    screens, ie authz for EditExample even though not for ExampleApp or
    any other screens in that app
  - Record-level authorization (ArtifactAuthzRecord/Cond)
  - Authorization with a service (ArtifactAuthzService)
- Tools Screens
  - Artifact Hit Bins
  - Audit Log

- Simplified sequenced ID API for both primary and secondary sequenced IDs
  and moved configuration to entity definition, and methods to EntityValue
- Cleanups for xml-actions elements: from-field to from, call-service to
  service-call, call-script to script; better now than later to make the
  XML a bit cleaner and more clear (for example from-field can be any
  groovy expression and the -field implies otherwise)
- Significantly more testing and bug fixes related to synchronization,
  performance (WAY faster, but more room for improvement), transactions,
  style, etc

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-preview2 - 01 Mar 2011
===========================================================================

With release 1.0-preview2 the Moqui Framework is now nearly complete and
has sufficient functionality to build a wide variety of functional and
useful enterprise, or less formal, applications. This release includes a
functional example application with various screens demonstrating features
of the framework and recommended practices and patterns to use when
developing with Moqui.

While not feature-complete for the planned 1.0 feature set, the
1.0-preview2 release is ready for early adopters. For those interested,
this is a great time to try out Moqui for a pet project or even a more
formal project that is just getting started and won't be deployed in
production for at least a few months.

Feedback on functionality and bugs by early adopters would be extremely
helpful for the project at this point, both to validate (or invalidate...)
designs and to more extensively test the implementation.

This release includes:

- All of the great features of 1.0-preview1
- Significant updates to Example application screens (most now working)
- Added various configuration options and examples for flexible deployment
  and overriding templates for screen macros, xml-actions, etc
- Executable WAR file is more self-contained, ie less required in runtime
  but with a few more override options in runtime too
- Root web screen split to support undecorated subscreens and apps

- XML Screens
  - Screen form elements, all implemented (including file upload, *-find)
  - Standalone screens that are rendered independently of parent screens
    and can still be subscreens of any other screen
  - Screen pre-actions that all run before any parent screen is rendered
    to allow for setting parameters in parent screens, setting up general
    things, etc
  - Screen single-form HTML uses fieldset and label instead of a table
  - Screen form header-field widget rendering
  - Screen form header-field.@show-order-by support
  - Screen form localized output formatting, based on service parameter
    format if applicable, otherwise on format specified in form field
  - Output encoding, configurable on various screen/form elements
  - I18n (with L10nFacade) for labels and titles in screens, forms, menus
  - Added jquery and jquery-ui and the smoothness theme
  - Added container-dialog widget that creates a button that when clicked
    on opens a dialog with the contents of the container-dialog.
  - Added datetimepicker, which is the standard jquery datepicker plus the
    timepicker add-on, combined using some code from Apache OFBiz
  - Extended and now using database-driven screen visual themes
  - Can send Maps to HTTP response as JSON string (Web Facade), example of
    this is in EditExample.xml
- Service Facade
  - Service expand auto-parameters, get parameters from implements
  - Finished implementation of async/scheduled service calls
  - Service run on commit and on rollback of current tx
  - Service parameter type/subtype checking
  - Service parameter ESAPI/Antisamy HTML checks (any/safe/none)
  - Service authentication
  - Service parameter conversion/parsing and validation checks
  - Service ECA rules
- Entity Facade
  - View-entity fixes and testing, now most view-entity options work
  - Support entity-find.search-form-inputs element for form *-find fields
  - Automatic cache clearing for one, list (using RA cache), count caches
  - Entity extension
  - Entity audit-logging
  - Entity field encryption
  - Entity ECA rules
  - Support offset and limit as LIMIT/OFFSET or OFFSET/FETCH depending on
    configuration on the database element in the Moqui conf file
  - Database meta-data support for adding indexes when tables added
  - Automatically add columns if missing in table check
  - Add foreign keys to existing tables when table created
  - Added EntityDbMeta.createForeignKeysForExistingTables() to check the
    foreign keys of all entities with existing tables and add missing ones
    where both tables exist; useful to run once all desired tables have
    been created (through a data load, test script, etc) to round out the
    DB meta-data

  - LiquiBase integration, entity.change-set element
  - EntitySync tool
  - Entity complex aliases in views (EntityDefinition:246)
