Moqui Framework 1.6.0 is a major new feature and bug fix release.

TODO

Non Backward Compatible Changes

- The Screen Facade and ScreenRender interfaces are now in the

    HttpServletResponse
  - Added screen and transition render tests for the System and Tools apps
  - All XML Form field widgets now support expansion in tooltip string
  - When a form-single is rendered the form map is added to a pushed

    directly in expressions in @condition, @text, etc attributes
- Integration Features
  - New Service REST API tool
    - define REST resources and methods in XML files (see rest-api-1.6.xsd)
    - map methods under resources to service calls and entity operations
    - see example Service REST API in example.rest.xml
    - call REST methods through the /rest/s1 transition
    - see example client calls in the rest.xml screen definition file
    - get Swagger API definition from /rest/service.swagger
    - get RAML API definition from /rest/service.raml
  - New RestClient API, available through ec.service.rest(), with various
    options for doing HTTP requests and parsing response
  - Added json-schema for Entity REST API: for all entities get
    /rest/entity.json, for a single entity get /rest/entity.json/${name}.json
  - Added RAML API definition for Entity REST API at /rest/entity.raml
  - Added Swagger API definition for Entity REST API at /rest/entity.swagger
  - Entity REST API supports master definitions through
    /rest/m1/${entity}/${master} or /rest/v1/${entity}?master=${master};

  - Added RAML API definition for Entity Master REST API at /rest/master.raml
  - Added Swagger definition for Entity Master REST at /rest/master.swagger
  - SystemMessage entity has additional fields to identify messages
  - Changed receive#SystemMessage to an interface, now use
    receive#IncomingSystemMessage for remote calls, will call the
    SystemMessageType.receiveServiceName service if specified to save message
  - Added EDI handler (parser and generator), used in Mantle for X12 messages
- Email Features
  - Various improvements to email message polling (calling EM-ECA rules)
    including support for Java System Properties pass through and fix for
    password pass through for IMAPS/etc
  - Email ECA structure significantly improved, for details see the
    org.moqui.EmailServices.process#EmailEca service interface
  - Improved sending EmailTemplate with support for reply to and bounce
    addresses from EmailTemplate and CC/BCC addresses from both EmailTemplate
    and service parameters
- Security Features
  - Better protection against CSRF/XSRF attaches with a session token as per
    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRF_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet;
    - when enabled (webapp.@require-session-token in Moqui Conf XML file not
      false) a moquiSessionToken parameter must be passed
    - applies to all transition requests with actions by all methods except,
      GET after the first request in a session
    - for REST/etc API calls with authentication for each call is ignored
    - can be disabled per screen transition with @require-session-token=false
  - Password reset now sets a reset password separate from the current
    password that may only be used to change the password; current password
    stays valid for password change or login (if email-require-change=false)
- Entity Features
  - Added field.@create-only attribute, defaults to entity.@create-only
    value, create only now checked at field level on update (only at entity
    level on delete)
  - New concept of explicit master entity definitions with details made up of
    related entities; definitions go in new entity.master element; there are
    new methods in EntityValue, EntityList, and EntityFind to get value Maps
    for the master record plus all details
  - EntityDataLoader has new options for loading CSV files to specify the
    entity or service name and field list through the API instead of in
    records 1 and 2 of the CSV file
  - EntityDataLoader has new defaultValues Map option for default values to
    be used by field/parameter name for entity stores and service calls
- Components may now have a component.xml with a single component element,
  the same component element that is used in the Moqui Conf XML file; if a
  name is specified it will override the directory name; added a depends-on
  element which modifies the component order at runtime
- Component directories (referred to by component-list.component-dir in the
  Moqui Conf XML file) now supports a components.xml file (must use that
  filename) to specify which components to load and in which order
- Localized strings may now contain a double hash (##) to specify context
  where a single word in the default language (ie English) is ambiguous; at
  runtime if no matching LocalizedMessage is found the text before the
  double hash will be used to lookup records or as the default value
- Service to lookup IP geo data (from freegeoip.net), called by default on
  login (can be disabled with server-stats.@visit-ip-info-on-login)

Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue in the Tools EntityDetail screen where entities with many
  dependents (like Enumeration, Uom, etc) caused an out of memory error;
  GitHub issue #149
- Fixed XML Actions FTL error for entity-find.@having-econditions
- Fixed issue where ResourceFacadeImpl.setInContext localized values when
  expanding; caused problems with set elements in widget-template-include
- Fixed issue with multiple render-mode elements where there is no
  text.@type attribute; GitHub issue #158

  setup for the moqui/moqui project with a badge reporting status
- Changed form-list macros to use HTML table elements instead of div with
  table styles
- Various localization improvements
- ArtifactHit and ArtifactHitBin timing fields are now number-decimal
  instead of number-integer to record sub-millisecond timing; internal
  changes for more precise timing, also calc of standard deviation, etc;
  existing databases may need column type changes
- Added link.@entity-name and related attributes for convenience as an
  alternative to display-entity or link with row-actions lookup
- Added link.@tooltip attribute for tooltips on any link
- The Auto Screens in the Tools app now have a link to get screen/form XML
  for the various forms (find, CrUD) for the current entity; handy as a
  starting point when creating a bunch of new screens for various entities
- Entity Data Loader class, command line, and DataImport screen now support
  a list of component names to load data from when loading by data type
- The entity.@create-only attribute now only checked if fields are changed
- If service-call.@ignore-error=true now logs and clears error messages
- Added support for a 'default' locale value for LocalizedMessage and
  LocalizedEntityField as a fallback if no locale or base locale record is
  found; used to better support placeholder message keys meant to always
  be localized
- Added @text-map attribute to link, label, and display for expanded fields
  in the @text attribute
- Added shortened names for various methods in ResourceFacade (template,
  script, expression, condition, expand) and localize in L10nFacade
- Added link.@encode attribute like that on other elements, encodes link
  text by default (avoid HTML injection based attacks)
- Added image.@condition, @style, and @parameter-map attributes and
  parameter sub-element like those on label, etc
- Added screen history drop-down to navbar, WebFacade code to keep history
- Screen menu names are now expanded (put data prep in pre-actions)
- Added screen.@menu-image and @menu-image-type attributes; when rendering
  a screen gets the last menu-image in the screen render path (available
  from ScreenUrlInfo)

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed issues with adding missing columns to database
- Fixed issues where EntityValue objects from cache were mutable
- Fixed issue where requests to different hostnames for the same server
  resulted in redirecting to the first hostname used in a request
- The Gradle loadSave and reloadSave tasks now handle H2 files as well
- The EXAMPLE1 tenant is now setup for H2 instead of Derby, fixing issues
  with testing of tenant and related functionality
- Fixed issue with form field options in certain cases where an EntityValue
  was pushed onto the context (which should never be done)
- Fixed issue when a drop-down with dynamic-options depends on a field with
  a display or display-entity widget as the hidden input did not have the
  @id attribute needed to get the field's value
- Fixed issue when alias-all is used with a member-entity that is a
  view-entity where all expanded aliases would be ignored in the outer view
- Fixed issue where member-entities of a view-entity used as a
  member-entity and the fields of that view member-entity were aliased with
  an alias-all with a @prefix or other name not matching the field were
  trimmed because no matching field was in the fields to select
- XML Actions ${iterate.@entry}_hasNext is now _has_next to be more
  consistent with section-iterate and others using this FTL inspired name
- Fixed issue with select column names when doing a distinct query with
  upper cased order by fields, now adds function to select clause as well
  as order by clause (GitHub issue #146)


===========================================================================
Release 1.5.2 - 2 May 2015
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.5.2 is a minor new feature and bug fix release.

The main improvement in this release is significantly better performance.
Overall performance is about 3x faster, with various lower level entity and
service operations around 10x faster. There are also various improvements
to stability, especially in production under a load. Some of these are from
better concurrency handling and other improvements in Moqui, others from
updates to libraries including a newer version of Bitronix TM.

The H2 database is now used by default instead of Derby. There is now a
CUPS server integration using Cups4J including services to print, and
services and screens for managing printers and print jobs.

There are fixes for running Moqui on Microsoft Windows, and for using the
OrientDB database through the Entity Facade. These were both supported in
the past but were broken in recent versions of Moqui Framework.

New Features:

- Added H2 1.4.187, configuration for H2 Database
  - set as default embedded database instead of Derby
  - in default setup can be accessed remotely on port 9092 using a URI like
    jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/MoquiDEFAULT
  - H2 console available by default (see web.xml) at /h2
- Updated Atomikos to 4.0.0M4, Bitronix to 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT (built from
  source in GitHub repo), FreeMarker to 2.3.22, Groovy to 2.4.3
- Updated OrientDB to 2.0.8, tested and fixed a few issues
- Updated Apache Commons Codec to 1.9, Apache Commons Logging to 1.2,
  Apache HttpClient and HttpCore to 4.4.1, JNA to 4.1.0
- Significant performance improvements based on profiling
  - a big part of this is using the Groovy @CompileStatic annotation for
    strict typing and direct method calls for improved performance in many
    frequently called parts of the framework
  - other approaches used in various places include better caching and
    local tracking of frequently used data and integer for loop iteration
    instead of using Iterator (or for in, for :)
  - overall the overhead of advanced features of the framework such as
    artifact authorization and hit counting are significantly reduced
  - entity, service, and screen operations are dramatically faster
  - observed common entity and service operations 3-8x faster, and
    screen rendering around 3x faster; with these updates some performance
    improvement is always possible but this gets pretty close to the limit
  - this effort involves over 3000 lines of code changes, nearly 10% of the
    roughly 35k lines of Java & Groovy code in the framework implementation
- ScreenUrlInfo has been cleaned up with single use parts split into the
  UrlInstance class; these are currently internal implementation classes so
  this isn't an API change, but this is a non-backward compatible change
  and some code using the ScreenRenderImpl and ScreenUrlInfo may need to be
  updated similar to the changes in DefaultScreenMacros.html.ftl
- Added section.@condition attribute that does the same thing as
  section.condition.expression but more concise
- CUPS print server integration and print job management services and admin
  screens in the System app; can render XSL-FO screens to PDF/etc and
  print, print ResourceFacade resources, and direct print other documents
- Various improvements to concurrency and load handling
- Production mode artifact cache warming now does more so that initial page
  loads are much faster, and heavy loads from start are handled better

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed issue with XML Form display-entity where an EntityValue was pushed
  onto the context (bad in the first place, changed to push Map clone of
  EV) and if there was an error in the string expand it stayed
- No longer create auto reverse relationships for relationships going to
  the same entity, results in multiple relationships with the same name and
  the reverse one can get picked up and isn't the one desired
- Fixed issues with loading KIE modules and JAR files from components on
  Windows caused by issue in BaseResourceReference URI handling
- Fixed issue with startup-add-missing=true and runtime-add-missing=false
  where entities in a group without an explicit datasource would never have
  their tables created
- Fixed issues with OrientDB wrapper objects related to EntityFacade
  changes since 1.5.0

===========================================================================
Release 1.5.1 - 29 Mar 2015
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.5.1 is a minor new feature and bug fix release.

New features in this release include various enhancements to DataDocument
functionality and the introduction of the search#CountBySource to be used
for analytics and reporting using ElasticSearch as the data store. Note
that as part of these changes the fields of the primary entity of a
DataDocument are in the root map/object of the document instead of in a
map/object names for the primary entity.

There is also new functionality for handling JSON documents in more places
including load/import and write/export of entity data and a generic entity
REST interface following various RESTful best practices. See the rest.xml
screen file for more details (comments there with examples, etc).

New Features:

- Updated Elasticsearch to 1.5.0, Apache Lucene to 4.10.4
- More consistent handling of empty in service, entity, and screen when we
  don't want the Groovy definition of empty (ie don't consider 0 numbers
  or false boolean to be empty)
- Support for CharSequence in various places (context, entity, service,
  screen, etc) to handle not just String but also GString when it doesn't
  get converted and StringBuffer, StringBuilder, etc where convenient
- Improved HTTP response code handling, now uses 401 only for authc/login
  failures, 403 (forbidden) for artifact authz failures, and 429 (too many
  requests) for tarpit failures
- Entity auto services (create, update, and store) now support related
  records in Maps and Lists in the Map passed to the service call,
  following the same pattern used for incoming JSON documents (the same
  code is used for both)
- Entity Facade
  - More consistent handling of is-null; support is-not-null, not-between
  - Document mappings (type definitions, etc) are now put automatically
    when a DataDocument indexed with ElasticSearch is first used (by index
    or search) with types for numbers, dates, etc needed for analytics and
    also not_analyzed set for all id* type entity fields
  - In DataDocument the fields on the primary entity are no longer in a
    Map/object but rather are in the root of the document, simpler and more
    consistent with the structure used elsewhere
  - Added EntityServices.search#CountBySource service to do analytics
    searches using ElasticSearch; there is a real-world example of the use
    of this service in Mantle for current and projected inventory data
  - Added @short-alias attribute for entity and relationship, can be used
    for any entity or relationship reference, but mainly meant for use in
    entity REST request URLs and other entity path operations
  - Implemented automatic entity REST interface that supports GET/find,
    POST/create, PUT/store, PATCH/update, and DELETE/delete operations;
    supports a variety of bulk operations and flexible find options
    including pagination and the various features of
    EntityFind.searchFormInputs() that are used for find forms in XML
    Screens; this is a RESTful API that follows various best practices
    and security is handled through artifact authorization and tarpits at
    the entity level; for examples see the comments in rest.xml
  - Improved relationship info (EntityDefinition.getRelationshipsInfo())
    and dependent entity handling
  - Added EntityDetail screen in the Tools app with info about entity and
    related entities
  - EntityDataLoader and EntityDataWriter, along with the DataImport and
    DataExport screens in the Tools app, now support JSON files including
    embedded related (or other entity) records like the REST interface
  - EntityDataLoader for XML files also supports nested records; with the
    PK field inheritance from parent records this can significantly reduce
    redundancy in data load files and make them easier to read/maintain
  - EntityDataWriter for XML files now exports nested elements for
    dependent records using a similar pattern to that used for JSON out

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed issue with link.@dynamic-load-id attribute loading the result of
  the load() function instead of doing nothing but calling the load method;
  this caused issues in browsers like FireFox that render the result of a
  a.@href javascript: expression
- Fixed issue with sparse screen paths (starting with a '//') where a
  high-level screen like the echopath screen with @allow-extra-path=true
  would be used instead of a more complete, and correct, match; sparse
  paths no longer allow extra path elements, which is desirable for
  intended use of sparse paths to specify target screens, transitions, and
  sub-screen resources; extra path elements generally come in request URLs
  where sparse paths are not allowed anyway
- Fixed issue where adding ".xml" to a request URL for a screen would treat
  the screen XML file as a sub-screen resource and return the contents; now
  treats screen XMl files as if they don't exist, ie results in a 404 error
- Fixed issue with EntityFind where if a ListCondition with an OR operator
  was passed before passing other conditions then the top-level conditions
  would be OR'ed together instead of AND'ed
- Fixed issues with Date (without time, ie java.sql.Date) parsing and
  formatting due to weirdness with time zone and truncating the time part
  of the Date representation in long millis since epoch; see comments in
  L10nFacadeImpl.groovy for more details
- Fixed issue with canonicalized (for security, decoding) parameters
  including JSON documents passed in the body where lists containing
  anything other than strings (CharSequence actually) were emptied; most
  lists in parameters only contain strings so this hasn't come up before,
  but for more complex JSON documents it is an issue
- Fixed issues with determining dependent entities, now more consistent by
  looking for reverse relationships with appropriate criteria
- Fixed a few issues with the Tools auto screens and entity edit screens
  related to relationships


===========================================================================
Release 1.5.0 - 07 Mar 2015
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.5.0 is a major new feature and bug fix release.

This release includes a number of UI improvements in XML Screens and Forms
including lazy-loading trees (with jstree), more complete database-driven
forms, general form response saving (together support DB-driven surveys,
and can also be used with any XML Form), ability to include entire screen
sections in other screens, required screen parameters so explicit checking
isn't necessary (most screens with parameters need this), significant style
improvements based on updated Metis (and Bootstrap, jquery, etc), a new
dark/light style switcher, and restored use of screen themes to load CSS,
JS, images, inserted text and templates, and much more.

One major new feature in this release is EntitySync which duplicates data
between systems based on update timestamps. This can move data between
tenants, systems on different networks and used for different purposes, and
so on. Another major feature is the system-system messaging that is a store
and forward message queue, or in other words it persists outgoing messages
to allow retry in sending or even modify and retry, and incoming messages
to allow retry in processing, modify and retry, etc. This can be used along
with or instead of a lower-level message queue to provide more visibility
at a business level and to facilitate production support for messages with
issues. It is configurable so that different services can be used to
process different messages (send, receive, consume). Both EntitySync and
System-System Messages are new and not yet vetted in production so should
be considered beta features as of this release.

The Tools application has been split into System and Tools applications
targeted at the different roles of system administrators and developers.
There are new screens in the System app for security (users, user groups,
and artifact groups with preferences, permissions, authz, tarpits), for
Entity Sync to review status and create/maintain, and for System-System
Messages to review incoming and outgoing messages and handle issues with
messages. There are also improvements in the Tools screens for developers
including various Auto Screen improvements, an Artifact Statistics screen
with counts of various artifacts and improved service detail with
highlighted display of actual and generated source.

NOTE: This release, just as the previous, required JDK 7 to run. It also
includes the invoke dynamic variation of Groovy (which requires Java 7)
for significantly enhanced performance.

NOTE: The webroot, tools, and example components are now in the new
runtime/base-component directory instead of the runtime/component directory
to keep them separate from add-on components. There is also a new
runtime/component-lib directory for library components that are loaded
after mantle (if present) and before the components in the
runtime/component directory.

New Features:

- Updated Apache Camel to 2.14.1, Apache CSV to 1.1,
  Apache Derby to 10.11.1.1, Apache FOP to 1.1 (now includes Batik 1.7),
  Apache Lucene to 4.10.3, Apache Shiro to 1.2.3, Ehcache to 2.9.0,
  ElasticSearch to 1.4.4, Freemarker to 2.3.21, Groovy to 2.4.1 (indy),
  Liquibase to 3.3.2, OrientDB to 1.7.9, Winstone to 1.7.0
- Updated Metis Admin Template to version 2.2.7, thanks to contribution
  from Osman Nuri Okumuş (onokumus), the author of Metis; this updates
  jQuery to 2.1.1, jQuery UI to 1.11.0, Bootstrap to 3.2.0, and various
  other updates
- More profiling (with JProfiler) and performance improvements, especially
  in the Entity and Screen Facades
- Added elFinder connector for the Moqui ResourceFacade
- Added Tools screen to browse ResourceFacade resources using elFinder
- Can now schedule services with a cron string in Tools Run Service screen
- Added cache warming on start (disabled in dev conf)
- Various improvements to Tools screens for layout and pagination
- Added convert#Uom service
- Added clone#DataDocument service
- Added WebFacade.sendResourceResponse() method to stream content from any
  Resource Facade location
- Artifact Authz now gets parameters from entity and service operations
  and if new ArtifactGroupMember.filterMap field is populated checks each
  filter entry to see if it matches corresponding parameter entry,
  otherwise authz rule does not apply
- Added System-System Message functionality with persisted outgoing and
  incoming messages and services to manage queueing, sending, receiving,
  and consuming
- Added UI for administration of System-System Messages
- Added UI for Security administration (users, user groups, and artifact
  groups with preferences, permissions, authz, tarpits)
- Added UI for EntitySync administration
- Added sync service call transaction options (ignore and cache) to match
  those available through the service definition
- Made XML Actions service-call.@transaction options match those in the
  service definition, added code generation for all options
- Added ServiceFacade.callJsonRpc() method to more conveniently call remote
  JSON-RPC services
- XML Screen:
  - Added tree element for XML Screen that renders a lazy-loaded tree with
    links using jstree (currently version 3.0.3); see the wiki.xml screen
    in HiveMind for an example of its use
  - Added section-include element to include a section from another screen
  - Various XML Screen elements have more consistent id behavior with
    string expansion and adding the listEntryIndex suffix, which is now
    also set in section-iterate (in addition to form-list as before)
  - Added container-box to XML Screen with header, toolbar, and body
  - Improved container element in XML Screen with better id handling and
    a type which (in HTML) translates to the tag used.
  - Added @style attributes to link and label in XML Screen
  - In a form-list with no @list-entry attribute creates a
    ${@list}_entry field along with the _index and _has_next fields for
    convenience in getting at the object in the List (which implements the
    Map interface, often an EntityValue and nice to get at it directly)
  - Added form-single.field-layout.field-row-big element to do what
    field-row used to do with more than 2 field-ref elements, putting all
    fields in a single column
  - Put CSS references back in theme instead of direct in webroot.xml
  - Added support for header logo, header title, body class, and footer
    items in theme to make applications easier to brand through theme data
  - Added theme support for header navbar items with FTL snippets coming
    from the database theme records, example in the Mantle MyAccount app to
    show count of unread incoming messages and link to view them
  - Added dark/light pseudo-theme switcher, switches body classes from
    Bootstrap on the fly and saves user preference (default comes from
    theme)
  - Links are now disabled when going to a screen the user is not
    authorized for along with failed transition condition
  - Screen paths can now start with a // and be a sparse path where each
    name in the path is searched for in the subscreen hierarchy from the
    root screen; can also find content this way; note that this may
    involve loading a lot of screen definitions and in dev mode will be
    slower, but in production (cache timeouts turned off) the full
    expanded path is cached as are the screen definitions so there is very
    little overhead
  - To help with XML Screen loading overhead, especially in dev mode with
    timeouts turned on, now only reloads if the file's last modified time
    has changed
  - Added date-period form field widget to show drop-downs for
    this/next/last day/week/month/year as an alternative to an explicit
    date range
  - Added link.@dynamic-load-id attribute to load a link into a
    dynamic-container using its ID
  - Added 'screen' option for link.@url-type to refer directly to a screen
    without going through a transition (technically transition can do this
    too, but looks funny); made @url-type an expanded string
  - Added support for screen.parameter.@required attribute, show error
    message instead of rendering screen if a parameter is not passed
  - XML Form text-line auto-complete now passes through parameters defined
    on the screen and transition
  - Added XML Form text-line.ac-show-value attribute which defaults to true
    and if set to false doesn't use the span by the input box to show what
    was selected
  - DbForm forms can now be used independently rather than just modifying
    existing XML Screen forms by using 'moqui.screen.form.DbForm' or
    'DbForm' as the location, before the hash (#), in the @extends
    attribute
  - Added FormResponse/Answer entities to save form responses from any form
    based on form field names; can be used with DbFrom to have flexible
    database driven survey forms
  - Autocomplete fields (with text-line.@ac-transition) now hide the
    ID/value and put the label in the input box; they also do a server call
    with the initial value to get a label for it if there is no
    @ac-initial-text attribute
  - Added container-row and row-col elements for 12 column responsive
    layouts currently implemented with the Bootstrap 12 col styles
  - Added transition-include element to reuse transition definitions
  - Added @condition attribute to link and label elements
  - Added support _openDialog parameter or context field to specify a
    dialog (container-dialog or dynamic-dialog) to show on load
- Entity Facade:
  - Added in operator (_op) for searchFormInputs/search-form-inputs
  - Added entity.field.@default attribute with a Groovy expression to set a
    default for a field based on other fields, constants, etc
  - Added DataDocumentCondition.operator field, uses same operator values
    as XML Actions econdition.@operator
  - Added update option to field.enable-audit-log to create audit records
    for updates only, not creates
  - Added entity.@sequence-primary-prefix attribute for a per-entity prefix
    that can be and expanded string expression using field values, etc
  - Removed EECA triggers for find operations; these are not generally
    useful and add overhead to the typically significant number of find
    operations, including cached ones
  - Initial implementation of EntitySync feature with example in the
    example component; should be considered beta but has gone through
    various tests in non-production environments
  - Added entity.@enable-audit-log attribute which is used as the default
    for all fields of the entity
  - Added EntityAuditLog.artifactStack field with the artifact stack used
    to do the audited update
  - Entity ECA rules that run after an update and have
    get-original-value=true now really get the originalValue from before
    the update even though they run after.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed security issue where current password was stored in
  UserPasswordHistory with 2-way encryption. Now only previous passwords
  are stored in UserPasswordHistory on password change, and they are stored
  in the hashed (one-way encrypted) form along with the salt and hash type.
- Fixed delete buttons not working on the Find Auto Screen
- Fixed links with images (link.image element) FTL error
- Required service parameters used to use the Groovy definition of empty
  but this is annoying for numbers and such (a zero is generally a valid
  non-empty service parameter), so now uses null for any object or zero
  length String as the definition of empty for required parameters
- Fixed issues with complex-alias where aliased entities were not add
  to list of aliased entities used and alias level function was not added
- Fixed tx cache issue where a value could be updated after putting it into
  the cache causing an attempt to read the original to get an updated value
- Changed ResourceReference.init() to use ExecutionContextFactory instead
  of ExecutionContext for cases where the object is long-lived
- Fixed search#DataDocuments issues with documentType parameter, adding it
  to the count query (was getting wrong counts because it was left out),
  set to null if an empty String as ElasticSearch treats that as a real one
- Fixed issue with a distinct query where order by fields are not selected,
  Entity Facade now automatically selects order by fields for distinct
  queries
- Fixed issue with merging row-actions in list forms, was cloning
  row-actions node instead of the actions nodes under it
- Fixed issue with form-list-column nodes not getting removed when merging
- Fixed issue with deepCopyNode copying attributes, the original Node's
  attribute Map was used instead of being copied allowing attributes to be
  modified in the copy of the Node
- Fixed thread deadlock issue in dev mode (with ArtifactHit entity logging
  enabled) caused by refreshing DataFeed and DataDocument settings in a
  scheduled job and page request happening around the same time
- Fixed thread contention issue checking ArtifactHit near startup
- Fixed issue with EntityValue.checkFks using find instead of findAll to
  get type one relationships
- Fixed issue with lastUpdatedStamp not getting set on updates
- Fixed fairly recent issue with service auth* parameters being ignored in
  service calls, especially remote service calls
- EntityFind.count() now selects all fields by default to match what list()
  and iterator() do, and to not mess things up when calling count() before
  calling iterator()
- In XML Forms the display and display-entity field types no longer default
  to the value from the @text attribute, if there is no direct entry value
  the hidden field should be empty
- Fixed issue with Quartz service calls and job data associated with the
  trigger, now gets data map from job and trigger
- Fixed issue with the Content-Type HTTP header in JSON requests when it
  has one or more parameters.

===========================================================================
Release 1.4.1 - 01 Aug 2014
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.4.1 is a minor new feature and bug fix release. Many of
the new features and bug fixes are related to multi-tenant support
including better isolation of tenants and tenant provisioning services.
Other fixes and improvements are related to Service ECA rules, jobs, DB
setup, and the tx cache.

This release also has various embedded documentation (annotations, etc)
improvements done along with the Making Apps with Moqui book which is now
available and has comprehensive documentation of Moqui Framework and a
summary of Mantle Business Artifacts.

NOTE: Starting with this version Moqui Framework requires Java 7 or later
because updated libraries require Java 7. Partly because of this Moqui
itself will also start to use Java 7 features.

New Features:

- Updated Apache Jackrabbit to 2.8.0, Apache Lucene to 4.8.1,
  ElasticSearch to 1.2.1
- Added UserGroupPreference, like UserPreference but for user groups.
  UserFacade.getPreference() now looks for group preference when no user
  preference is found.
- Changed Service ECA rules with @when of tx-commit or tx-rollback to
  attach to the transaction after the service is run so that results of the
  service run are available.
- Changed datasource configuration so that if datasources other than the
  one for the default-group-name (transactional) are not specified then
  the default-group-name one is used. There is a similar change for the
  TenantDataSource so that only the one for the default-group-name
  (transactional) is required for each tenant.
- Changed the Derby database default configuration to use a single
  MoquiDEFAULT database instead of separate transactional, analytical,
  nosql, and tenantcommon databases. Also changed the EXAMPLE1 tenant to
  use the tenantId as the database name, setting a pattern for other
  tenants.
- Added basic tenant provisioning services and various multi-tenant
  improvements and fixes to improve multi-tenant capabilities.
- Changed the way database time zone and locale work so they are the same
  for all users, either configured (@database-time-zone and
  @database-locale attributes on the moqui-conf.entity-facade element) or
  the Java system defaults. This is instead of using the user's time zone
  and locale because that is inconsistent and may get undesired values
  back, ie getting a different Timestamp object back because of a different
  user time zone.
- Added screen.@tenants-allowed attribute to restrict which tenant(s) a
  screen may be used in. The tools application is now restricted to the
  DEFAULT tenant using this attribute in Tools.xml.
- Changed Data Document _index field to be tenantId + "__" +
  DataDocument.indexName instead of just DataDocument.indexName to use a
  separate set of indexes for each tenant.
- Scheduled service jobs (including async) are now authorized before the
  job is scheduled, and when the username/userId is passed through does
  a no password authc for that user and turns off authz for the service
  call; this is a mechanism for handling service calls outside the main
  flow and still maintaining security.
- Changed the ArtifactHit/Bin artifactName for screen, screen-content, and
  transition to use their internal Resource Facade location (like
  component://...) instead of external URL

Bug Fixes:

- Changed commit() to rollback if commit fails to cleanup the transaction,
  can happen for example with TransactionCache has a DB error during
  pre-commit.
- ArtifactHit count now skipped for UserAccount to avoid infinite recursion
  (shows as a StackOverflow exception).
- EntityValue.containsKey() now returns true if there is a value for the
  key (even null), not just if it is a valid field name; this was
  inconvenient for various things, especially when treating EntityValue
  like a Map.
- Fixed issue where Service ECA rules with @when of tx-commit or
  tx-rollback were never run.
- Fixed issue with primary sequenced ID where cached current bank was
  shared among tenants even though DB values were separate, now cached
  current bank is also separate.
- Fixed GitHub issue #26 where the Calendar used for setting Date/etc
  values was not valid because the cached Calendar object in UserFacadeImpl
  was set in a query before getting the UserAccount, and not reset by
  getUserAccount() (ie calling clearPerUserValues()).
- Changed Quartz jobs (async and scheduled service calls) to run in the
  tenant they were initiated in instead of always in the DEFAULT tenant
- Fixed issue with setBlob and the Postgres JDBC driver (GitHub issue #28),
  similar to pull request #29.
- Fixed issue where SubscreensItem records with a userGroupId were filtered
  for the user active when the screen is first loaded as opposed to the
  user active each time the screen is rendered.
- Fixed issue where TransactionCache was ignored for entities with no
  table in the database, for OrientDB datasource, and in general for the
  EntityListIteratorWrapper object.

===========================================================================
Release 1.4.0 - 21 Mar 2014
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.4.0 is a major new feature and bug fix release.

Significant new features include: incorporating the Metis Admin Template,
adding Twitter Bootstrap and updating jQuery/jQueryUI, added Bitronix
transaction manager and pluggable JTA implementation support, added JBoss
KIE and Drools with framework and component knowledge base support,
Markdown support, JSON-RPC improvements, data loading improvements to
support CSV files and calling services to load data, a Quartz Scheduler
history in the DB and a Quartz persistence implementation, and services to
clean Quartz history as well as Moqui artifact hit and hit bin histories.

There are various bug fixes and stability improvements in this release for
things like PostgreSQL support, input data handling, form-list and general
pagination, Tomcat and other Servlet container deployment, and email
sending.

This release is backward compatible with the previous release (1.3.2),
though some configuration changes may be needed and custom HTML/JS may need
to be updated for the new JS libraries and Metis Admin Template.

New Features:

- Added the Metis Admin Template version 2.1.3
  (see https://github.com/onokumus/Bootstrap-Admin-Template);
  This includes an update to jQuery 2.0.3, Bootstrap 3.0.3,
  jQuery UI 1.10.3, and many other JS libraries.
- Added Bitronix BTM 2.1.4 as alternative to Atomikos
- Added JBoss KIE and Drools libraries (version 6.0.0.Final) and Moqui API
  additions for getting a KieContext, plus Moqui automatically loads and
  builds component kie directories when present
- Added Markdown4J 2.2
- Added Apache Commons CSV 1.0-SNAPSHOT 20140122
- Updated Apache HttpCore to 4.3.1, HttpClient to 4.3.2, Commons Logging
  to 1.1.3, Commons Codec to 1.6
- Updated Apache Lucene to 4.6.1, ehcache to 2.8.1, ElasticSearch to 1.0.1,
  Groovy to 2.2.2
- Updated Winstone to 1.0.5 (note this is very different from 0.9.10)

- Added ISO 8601 date/time parsing as another default in L10nFacade
- Added transition.@read-only attribute to skip XSRF check for insecure
  parameters when the transition does not modify data, and when data is
  not too sensitive
- Added transition.parameter sub-elements to declare additional parameters
  for a transition, just like and in addition to the screen parameters
- Added Markdown wiki support for files with extensions .md and .markdown
  using Markdown4J, and .md.ftl or .markdown.ftl for FTL + Markdown
- Added clean#ArtifactData service to remove ArtifactHit/Bin records older
  than a certain number of days (default 60), and a XML configured Quartz
  job with a trigger to run it every day at 2AM

- Entity Facade
  - Enhanced EntityDataLoader to also call services, just use the service
    name (leave out hash (#)) instead of entity name for the XML element
  - Enhanced EntityDataLoader to support CSV files with the entity or
    service name on the first line, then a header line, then the data lines
  - The entity-find-one.@value-field attribute can now be an existing Map
    that is not an EntityValue and if so entity fields are added to the Map
    instead of assigning the find result to @value-field
  - Improved EntityFind and EntityList for cached pagination
- Service Facade
  - Removed Dzhuvinov JSON-RPC jars (implemented internally now)
  - Improved and fixed JSON-RPC remote service client and auto server
  - Changed service.@validate=false to still apply defaults and type
    conversions for defined in-parameters, but not exclude undefined params
    or error on other validation errors
  - Added parameter.@default attribute which is like the @default-value
    attribute except that it is a field name or expression for the default
    field value.
  - Added SchedulerHistory and code to populate it on various Quartz
    Scheduler events, and scheduled service to clean up old records
  - Added EntityJobStore to do persistence for Quartz Scheduler through
    the Entity Facade instead of direct to DB for easier deployment and
    more consistent operation with other parts of Moqui Framework
- Transaction Facade
  - Added transaction-facade.@use-transaction-cache attribute, defaults to
    true, set to false to disable the TransactionCache globally
  - Added new transaction-facade sub-elements transaction-jndi and
    transaction-internal instead of single transaction-factory;
    transaction-internal has a class attribute to specify an implementation
    of the TransactionInternal interface to init/destroy the JTA impl
  - TransactionFacade now has active Synchronization registry like the
    active XAResource registry per transaction that existed before
  - Moved XAResource tools to Synchronization: TransactionCache, OrientDB
    tx handler, ServiceCallSpecial.registerOnCommit() and
    registerOnRollback(), Service ECA rule tx-commit and tx-rollback,
    EntityDataFeed

Bug Fixes:

- Due to some quirks in Shiro ehcache support it is disabled by default; it
  is still supported for use in distributed environments with shared auth
  cache (see shiro.ini for details)
- Fixed issue with entity-condition in a view-entity when the econdition
  value matched a localized string different from the original value
- Fixed issue with form-single and form-list.@transition when it matches
  a localized string (especially on MySQL or other DBs with case
  insensitive string matching), now only expands transition value if it
  contains a "${"
- Fixed not-like entity condition operator which was treated as like
- Fixed bug in EntityFind.searchFormInputs using ec.web.parameters instead
  of context; parameters are added to the context and other things may be
  too before this is called, so best to just use the context
- Changed data stored on login to be done in separate transactions so that
  the records aren't locked for the full surrounding tx preventing the
  same user from auth for other transactions
- Fixed issue with runtime/db directory not being included in gradle
  addRuntime and ant add-runtime, caused Derby to do funny things and
  OrientDB to not run at all under Tomcat and other external containers
- Fixed issue with Logger initializing before moqui.runtime is set when
  running under external servlet containers like Tomcat
- Fixed issue with DbResourceReference.putStream which tried to pass an
  InputStream to the JDBC driver, which isn't likely to be handled; now
  reads from the stream to a byte[] and wraps in a SerialBlob
- Fixed issue when startup-add-missing is true but runtime-add-missing is
  false it would not really check and add missing on startup
- Improvements to DB meta data handling for databases like Postgres that
  default to lower-case table, column, and foreign names
- Fixed issue with sri.getFieldValuePlainString() calling toString on
  BigDecimal objects as BigDecimal.toString() uses scientific notation by
  default and aside from being annoying the parser doesn't handle it and
  treats things like 100 represented as 1E2 as 1
- Fixed issue with iterate over a Map when key attribute is set where the
  key and value were switched in the specified field names
- Links (including URL parameter and hidden form) now handle Timestamp and
  BigDecimal the same as hidden form fields. This resolves issues with time
  zones for Timestamps, and with number parsing for BigDecimals.
- Fixed issues with transition path-parameter when screen has no actions
  where transition was not removed from the path name list and path,
  screen, and transition parameters were not expanded for response
  parameters
- Fixed issue in sendEmailTemplate.groovy where webappName was passed into
  the screen render for the HTML for the email, but not the plain text
- Fixed issues related to entity-find.@cache attribute used inconsistently
  in generated code, and more generally with filtering and pagination when
  using both entity-find.@cache=true and entity-find.search-form-inputs,
  especially along with entity-find.date-filter.

===========================================================================
Release 1.3.2 - 20 Nov 2013
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.3.2 is a minor new feature and bug fix release.

The main new feature is a write-through per-transaction cache that
effectively simulates the database for the scope of the transaction and
does all DB updates with a single connection just before commit. This
transaction cache is enabled on service definitions using the cache and
force-cache options for the service.@transaction attribute. With this in
place various Mantle services now run 2-3 times as fast with results
validated by extensive automated tests.

Another set of new features covers internal profiling for artifact
execution (entities, services, screens, transitions, etc). There are
various forms of output available including a full artifact call tree with
times, a consolidated tree to see own and total for artifacts in context,
and a hot spot list by own or total time. This is similar to Java-level
profiling tools but focuses on business level artifacts and with a low
overhead gathers data always but only generates reports when needed.

OrientDB is now included in the framework by default instead of only in an
addon component as before. This is useful as a general graph and document
database and as an alternative through the Entity Facade for high-write
entities like ArtifactHit.

New Features:

- Updated Apache Camel to 2.12.1, Ehcache to 2.7.5, Groovy to 2.1.9,
  Quartz Scheduler to 2.2.1, SLF4J to 1.6.6, Shiro to 1.2.2, Spock to 0.7
- Updated ElasticSearch to 0.90.7 and Lucene to 4.5.1
- OrientDB is now included in the framework by default instead of only in
  an addon component to have an embedded document and graph NoSQL database;
  this and other graph databases can be used through the Blueprint and
  Gremlin APIs
- Various changes to EntityDatasourceFactory, EntityFindBase, etc to better
  support other non-JDBC data sources like OrientDB
- Implemented write-through per-transaction cache (TransactionCache)
  enabled through the service.@transaction attribute cache and force-cache
  options or through direct initialization; this is a pretty big new
  feature that significantly improves performance of various types of
  services, but has certain limitations as described in the JavaDoc notes
  in the TransactionCache class and code using it should be tested
  thoroughly
- Added econdition.@or-null attribute to make the condition an or between
  the specified condition and null
- Added entity.@allow-user-field attribute to specify when UserField defs
  are considered, for security and performance reasons
- Added entity.@create-only attribute for immutable entities
- Added eeca.@get-original-value attribute to get the original (db) value
  if run on update or delete and before the entity operation
- Screen form-single forms automatically add a "_formMap" field to the
  context with the Map used for the form; useful for reused forms that may
  specify different form-single.@map values
- XML Actions iterate generates _index and _hasNext fields
- ArtifactFacade tracks artifact running time, keeps an hierarchical
  instead of flat history, and can print a tree of the history; can also
  create a consolidated tree across larger runs to see an overview of own
  and total time per artifact; can also create a hot spots list by own or
  total time per artifact to see which took the most time
- Added gradle tasks to save the Derby databases and ElasticSearch data
  after a load (loadSave) and to clean out and reload the saved data
  (reloadSave)
- Some improvements to error message logging and handling in data loader,
  ServiceTrigger, and set rollback only
- When tables are created on the fly they are now only created for write
  operations, finds just return no results if table does not exist and
  do not create the table

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed issue in ListCondition with null list entries, and improved the
  factory method with condition List parameter when List has only one
  condition to just use that condition
- Fixed issue in service input conversion treating empty values as nulls
- Fixed some minor and rare Entity Facade errors as part of more extensive
  testing for TransactionCache and a code cleanup and consolidation effort

===========================================================================
Release 1.3.1 - 20 Oct 2013
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.3.1 is a minor new feature, bug fix, and performance
enhancement release.

New Features:

- Performance improvements based on profiling (tested screens run
  around 1.3 to 2 times as fast)
- form-list and section-iterate automatically add *_index and
  *_has_next context fields following the pattern used in Freemarker
- formDisplayOnly parameter (or context value) to make the form render as
  display-only (read-only)
- dynamic and static layouts
  - static layout uses entire browser width and is CSS based
  - dynamic layout uses jQuery Layout plugin and supports closing,
    resizing, fixed header/footer, separate scrolling left/right, etc
- popup menus are in the header to save space and for easier layout
- set action inside form field sub-elements and widget-template-include for
  parameterized widget-template definitions
- XML Form pass through of matches (regexp) validation from service
- Added ServiceTrigger entity to call a service when the record is created;
  useful for triggering data setup services on data load and so on
- The loadData execution uses anonymous user for authc and allows any authz
  for services triggered on data load

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed extraneous close script tags in screen/form HTML output
- Fixed right/east container-panel field name so size, etc settings apply
- Fixed calls to startFormListRow that were missing new parameters added
  to the method; resolves SourceForce Bug #39
- Fixed issue with a form-list with header form in a dynamic-container; now
  updates within the containing div using the results of the form submit
- Fixed issue with service name comparison when running SECA rules
- Auto reverse relationships better support titles
- DataDocument no longer includes null fields, empty Maps and Lists
- Fixed issue with null oldStatusId and setting new statusChanged automatic
  fields in entity-auto service implementation
- Fixed entity-find.search-form-inputs.@input-fields-map attribute, groovy
  generated left out quotes
- Fixed NPE in EntityUserField code
- Changed searchFormInputs to default to equals instead of contains; more
  efficient queries and works for numbers, dates, etc
- Changed saved session messages and errors to be separate from
  MessageFacade ones so they still display but don't stop other services
  from running
- Fixed EntityFacadeImpl.getAllEntityNames() to not return invalid entity
  names, caused problems with AuthScreen, etc after an attempt to use an
  entity with an invalid name
- Fixed issue with Entity ECA rules where fields set to null were reset
  back to the value from the DB
- Fixed issues with export with dependents including making sure all
  auto-reverse relationships are in place and properly handing
  relationships with titles when deferring export for fk dependency
- Fixed issue where secondary sequenced ID did not preserve disableAuthz
- Fixed issue with DENY record not stopping sub-screens access

===========================================================================
Release 1.3.0 - 27 July 2013
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework 1.3.0 is a major new feature and bug fix release. The major
new features include the EntityFacade Data Document, Data Feed, and Data
Search (based on ElasticSearch) features, the User Notification Message
feature, and various improvements to XML Screens and Forms. This release is
backward compatible with Moqui Framework release 1.2.0 with the exception
that the StatusValidChange entity is deprecated by the new
StatusFlowTransition entity.

When updating to Moqui 1.3.0 from 1.2.0 or earlier existing databases may
need to be updated because the Entity Facade now uses full entity names
(with the package included in the name) for everything. The
SequenceValueItem.seqName may contain plain entity names (without package)
that need to be changed to full entity names (with package). This can be
done by adding records with the full entity name in the seqName field with
the same value as the original record in seqNum.

New Features:

- Updated Gradle build files to work with Gradle 1.6 (may not work with
  earlier versions)
- Updated Apache Camel to 2.11.1, Apache Commons Validator to 1.4.0,
  Apache Derby to 10.10.1.1, ehcache to 2.7.2, Freemarker to 2.3.20,
  Groovy to 2.1.6, Quartz Scheduler to 2.1.7
- Added ElasticSearch 0.90.2 and Lucene 4.3.1 ElasticSearch files are under
  runtime/elasticsearch and it is initialized and destroyed with the rest
  of the framework
- With ElasticSearch, Lucene, and full ehcache instead of just core the
  size of Moqui Framework has grown from ~24MB to ~42MB
- Both ElasticSearch and Camel can be disabled to not init automatically
- Introduced StatusFlow, StatusFlowItem and StatusFlowTransition entities
  for improved status flow support. A StatusItem may be used in multiple
  flows, each flow having its own set of status items and transitions.
- Entity Facade
  - Added EntityDynamicView.addRelationshipMember() method to easily add
    member-entity based on relationship definition
  - Added Entity Data Document feature configured by DataDocument* entities
    which produce a sort of view entity (built on the fly with
    EntityDynamicView); the actual data documents are nested Maps and Lists
    produced by the EntityFacade.getDataDocuments() method
  - Added Entity Data Feed feature configured by DataFeed* entities; a feed
    is associated with one or more DataDocuments that are pushed to a
    service or pulled through a method call; the first part implemented is
    a real-time push triggered by entity changes for entities that are part
    of associated DataDocuments and the document(s) produced and sent to
    the feed receive service when a transaction is successfully committed
  - Added index#DataFeedDocuments service to easily index all documents
    associated with a DataFeed within a date range
  - Added search#DataDocuments service which uses ElasticSearch; supports
    pagination and so on
  - Added Tool app screens for index, search, and export DataDocuments
  - Improved date/time and number parsing for String values passed to an
    entity, partly so that implicit entity-auto services are more usable
  - Changed to use full entity name (with package) in more places including
    the entity cache
- XML Screen and Form
  - Added XML Form fields-not-referenced element to specify where to render
    the fields not explicitly referenced under the field-layout element
  - Small adjustment to transition parameter so that if explicitly defined
    as empty that will be used instead of defaulting to value from context
    or web parameters
  - Screen transition response plain URLs now assemble parameters using
    response parameter sub-elements
  - Improved form-list with form-list-column so that hidden fields are
    always rendered along with the form element
  - Added span with id for form-list cell display fields and classes on it
    for currency and field value Java classes (BigDecimal, Timestamp, etc)
    plus CSS to center numbers and right align currency amounts
  - Added XML Form field widget element auto-widget-service and
    auto-widget-entity to do the same thing as auto-fields-* except that
    they are applied to a single field for more granular control without a
    bunch of ignores
  - Added dynamic-dialog element to XML Screens; like the container-dialog
    element but loads the dialog contents from the server when opened
  - Added form-list.@paginate-always-show attribute, defaults to true; set
    to false to hide pagination control and row count when there is only
    one page of rows to display; SourceForge feature request #8
  - Added widget-templates file and widget-template-include element under
    XML Form fields to include widget-templates for widget reuse
  - Added form-list.@skip-form element for use with plain tables that will
    have nothing to submit; in HTML leaves out form elements
  - Added dynamic-container element to easily setup a section of the screen
    that is loaded separately from the server for easy update
  - Added background-* attributes to form-single to submit the form in the
    background and optionally show a message on success and reload a
    dynamic-container by id
  - In HTML generation script tags spread throughout HTML are now
    consolidated into a single script tag at the end of the screen output
  - Added editable element like a label but when you click on it an edit
    box appears to allow editing of the single field (this uses the
    jeditable jquery plugin)
- Added WebFacade.sendTextResponse() method to send plain text response
- Added User NotificationMessage feature to send messages to users through
  active listeners or persist them to track receipt and handle delivery
  when the user is next available. The message is a JSON String
  (representing a Map). Custom listeners can be added as implementations
  of the NotificationMessageListener interface. Message pulling is also
  supported for things like message screens. Listeners may be created
  for delivery means such as WebSocket, email, etc.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed URLs for Mantle UBPL links using active screen URL as the default
  base URL instead of the full URL of the current screen
- Fixed issue where form-list-column and field-layout nodes in an extended
  screen modified the original node from the base screen
- Fixed issue in entity-auto create where automatically set fromDate was
  not returned in the service result
- Fixed issue in screens with a form-list and then a form-single where
  listEntryIndex bleeds over and results in a _?? to field IDs and such
- Fixed issue with date/time parsing and formatting to more consistently
  user user time zone, avoids time discrepancies between input and display
  while leaving hidden fields as plain toString/etc
- Fixed issue with date and time values going to and from the database when
  the current user has a time zone different from the system by passing a
  Calendar object with the user's time zone to the PreparedStatement and
  ResultSet methods for Date, Time, and Timestamp
- Fixed issue with automatic case insensitive order by on non-String
  fields; now ignored automatically when not applicable
- Fixed issue with hidden fields in form-list header-fields when rendered
  in HTML with the default macros where the title appeared even if all
  field types were hidden, and if @hide was set to true the hidden input
  would not be rendered
- Fixed issue in XML Form when a field-row is under a field-group element
  where the field-row was ignored and the fields in the group were
  displayed twice
- Fixed issue when making a condition with an empty Map, List, etc returns
  null instead of an invalid condition
- Fixed issue with entity find one on a view-entity with no PK fields where
  no matter the conditions it was considered a full set of PK field
  constraints causing it to throw out the actual find constraints
- Fixed issue with form-list formatting when the @multi=true attribute and
  form-list-column elements are both used in the same form
- Fixed issue where IN and NOT IN did not add parenthesis if the value was
  not a Collection; also added splitting of String values used with IN and
  NOT IN by comma for convenience in specifying these lists of ID values
- Fixed issues where sequenced values with a non-entity seqName threw an
  exception and increment by one didn't increment the bank, causing a
  duplicate key error from the database on insert
- Fixed issue in Auto Screens where automatic links had wrong parameter
  name for the entity name (had entityName, now aen)
- Fixed issue where if a standalone screen (or with lastStandalone set) has
  pre-actions the screens before it were not pushed to get authz setup;
  SourceForge Bug #30
- Fixed issue with display.@currency-unit-field attribute with numbers
  larger than 1000 because it used the BigDecimal String constructor to
  parse a String formatted with a comma thousands separator; the
  L10nFacade.formatCurrency() method now uses a proper locale-aware number
  parser to parse numbers, and the display FTL macro has been updated to
  use the field value object directly instead of changing it to a String
  and then parsing it back to format as currency; SourceForge Bug #31
- Fixed issue with two back-to-back form-list using skip-end on the first
  and skip-start on the second; now rows are simply appended as would be
  expected instead of multiple form-list-outer/etc elements
- Fixed issue where view-entity.entity-condition.date-filter did not work
  with an empty @valid-date attribute
- Fixed a few issues with EntityDynamicView (failure to get group name,
  some better error handling, etc)
- Fixed issue with view-entity automatic trimming based on used fields
  where a member-entity with no used fields but that is needed to joing to
  another member-entity with used fields was not included
- Fixed issue with tx-commit and tx-rollback parameter missing in method
  call to run service
- Fixed bug in MoquiStart where Manifest was sometimes null causing a class
  not found exception

===========================================================================
Release 1.2.0 - 30 Dec 2012
===========================================================================

Moqui Framework release 1.2.0 is a minor new feature release and a major
quality improvement release. This release has undergone significantly more
testing than previous releases because of a wider variety of functionality
that has now been built and tested using the framework, and because of a
unit testing effort (framework unit tests built using Spock).

The new features include popup menus (using the new jQueryUI menu widget),
dynamic-options in XML Form drop-downs with dependency on other fields,
automatic optimization of queries on view-entities to old select member
entities necessary, support for UUID generated primary keys, expanded JCR
support and an Example Content screen, and a number of small improvements
that generally make the framework easier to use and more reliable.

There are some non-backward-compatible changes in this release including
elimination of id-very-long from the data type dictionary (expanding the id
and id-long types), change to database configuration of subscreens to be
based on UserGroup instead of the individual UserAccount (this is a
primary-key change and may require a database metadata update and data
migration), and context isolation for service calls.

This release includes:

- Updated jQuery to 1.8.3 and jQuery UI to 1.9.2
- Updated Apache Camel to 2.10.1, Apache Derby to 10.9.1.0, Apache
  Jackrabbit to 2.5.2, Apache Shiro to 1.2.1, ehcache to 2.6.0, Groovy to
  2.0.5, OWASP ESAPI to 2.0.1, Quartz Scheduler to 2.1.6, and WikiText to
  1.8.0 (20121130)
- Support for Spock specification and unit testing framework run with the
  gradle "test" task, and a few entity, service, user, and resource tests
- XML Screens
  - Added popup type subscreens menu using new jQuery UI Menu widget to
    help compress header into single row of menus instead of layers of tabs
  - Moved JS file reference to webroot.xml instead of in the theme; all
    themes need them, and they are more closely related to HTML generated
  - Added subscreens.always-use-full-path attribute to use the full path in
    menus and such instead of minimal path; helpful for wiki and other
    screens that use relative URLs that are not based on the screen path
  - More support for configuring case-insensitive order-by
  - Added dynamic-options for drop-down to get options from a server
    request via AJAX request and can depend on other field(s) to use as
    parameters and triggers for updating options on change, including
    example in the EditExample screen
  - Added text-line.@format attribute like display.@format
  - Field values are not automatically converted to strings before going
    to the FTL file for more control over formatting
  - Added screen.always-actions element with actions that will run
    whenever the screen is in the path, whether rendered or not, and
    before both rendering screens and running transitions
  - After login and other screen-last redirects parameters declared on the
    screen are now included in the URL and not just in the session
- Service Facade
  - Inline and script services can leave out parameter values in the
    context and they will be picked up, instead of setting explicitly in
    result Map
  - When auto-parameters has an entity-name specified the generated
    parameters will have entity-name and field-name attributes, and the
    auto-fields-service now looks for those to do better fields based on
    the entity field details
- Entity Facade
  - Added datasource.@startup-add-missing option; set to true to check
    tables for all entities in the database on startup and create missing
    ones
  - Added database.@use-schema-for-all option; set to true to include the
    schema name for non-table meta data (constraints, indexes, etc)
  - Entity find on a view-entity now automatically determines which
    member-entities to join in based on the fields selected, in order by,
    and in conditions; with this in place the need for DynamicViewEntity is
    minimal because you can just select the relevant fields and not worry
    about tables being joined in to the query that are not needed; this
    makes it much easier to write queries that will run well on large
    databases
  - Support for java.util.UUID sequenced primary IDs; can be configured
    per-entity and/or per-datasource
  - Added eeca.@get-entire-entity attribute to make sure we have the entire
    record and not just PK fields before doing update and delete ops
  - Improved handling and options for binary/blob fields
- Resource Facade
  - ExampleContent entity and corresponding screen that supports
    uploading and downloading JCR content
  - Support for username and password for remote JCR repository access
  - Added ResourceReference.findChildFile() method to replace the code
    used only for subscreen references, expand that functionality and make
    it reusable for wiki content, etc
  - Added methods to ResourceReference for writing to the resource
  - Wiki template renderer gets linkBaseUrl from ScreenRender
  - Added DbResourceReference and the DbResource/File entities to have a
    filesystem like data store in the database and accessed through the
    Resource Facade like any other (file, jcr/content, etc)
- Fleshed out ValidationError functionality including display in apps.xml
  and considering the ec.message.validationErrors list for storing error
  details in session between redirects, and changed entity and service
  validation to add ValidationErrors instead of plain error Strings
- Added MessageFacade.hasError() method to check for error messages or
  validation errors, and more reliably handle future forms of errors
- Screen in Tools app for SQL Query Run/View
- Improved classpath overrides for configuration and such in the
  runtime/classes directory for both add-runtime/addRuntime and executable
  WAR file deployment approaches
- EntityCondition has all JoinOperator and ComparisonOperator vales in it
  for convenience

Non-backward-compatible changes:

- Removed id-very-long entity field type and increased default length of id
  type to 40 and id-long type to 255.
- Changed *SubscreensItem.userId* to *userGroupId* for greater flexibility
  setting up subscreen structures and menus
-- this is consistent with how other database-driven artifacts are
   structured
-- to have a record apply to all users use the ALL_USERS userGroupId that
   all users are automatically a member of
-- for migrating other data a user will have to be a member of a group and
   that group can be a single-user group or you can simplify existing data
   by consolidating users into groups that have the same subscreens
- Local service calls (inline, java, and script) now run with an isolated
  context so that fields from whatever called the service are not
  available in the service (which would cause things to work when they
  really shouldn't and wouldn't work if it was called remotely)
-- make sure to retest all service calls as there could be hidden bugs
   where a service worked because whatever called it had certain fields

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed bug where secondary sequenced ID (setSequencedIdSecondary() method)
  was not finding IDs of existing records causing conflicting IDs to be
  generated
- Fixed bug with EntityFindBase.updateAll() to not use EntityListIterator
  as it caused problems trying to update records with the ResultSet open
- Added support for @confirmation attribute for hidden-form type links
- Fixed issue where transition.path-parameter values were not making it
  into the context since parameters were already added to the context
- Fixed issue in Data View screen with related entities using the full
  entity name (name with package)
- Updated startup in embedded mode to put jar files in a local temporary
  directory and build files to delete it just in case it doesn't get
  cleaned up on exit; should solve problem with dirty exit leaving temp
  files in the OS temporary file location which can be hard to find
- Fixed JCR repository connection, using RMI instead of DavEx by default
  (requires fewer jars for client while retaining full functionality)
- Fixed repository name and content path reference for JCR content in the
  ContentResourceReference class
- Fixed file upload temporary file being deleted before being accessed/used
- Fixed link with link-type=hidden-form within a form-single to not produce
  HTML with nested form elements
- Fixed anonymous-all and anonymous-view authenticate options for services
  and screens to login as the _NA_ user so the called services requiring
  authentication and permission will run as expected
- Fixed display.@currency-unit-field attribute handling
- Fixed XML Actions filter-map-list operation, wasn't quoting field names
- Fixed bug where authorization failures were getting logged but not
  throwing an exception to stop operations
- Fixed issue where the root screen was not added to the screenPathDefList
  causing incorrect push on the artifact facade's stack
- Fixed issue where the last statement of XML Actions might have been
  unintentionally considered to be the return/result Map
- Fixed issue with multi (multi-row) service calls where parameters shared
  between rows caused an attempt to process an additional non-existent row
- Changed screen transition transaction handling to rollback on error
- Fixed phantom parameter issue where declared parameters got a null value
  in the parameters to a service even if no null was passed in
- Changed the ContextStack.containsKey() to not always return true and
  added ContextBinding.java which extends groovy.lang.Binding and is used
  for all Groovy script running to do the same thing without all the
  side-effects; this fixes a number of bugs
- User login now works outside a web context
- Fixed authz and tx issues with user preferences
- Fixed issue with LocalizedEntityField because the code was still looking
  for the basic entity name and not the full entity name
- Fixed issue with parsing locale from the database to include separate
  language and country codes (was ignoring the country)
- Fixed bug on ServiceRun screen where parameters were not getting passed
- Fixed bug where group-by clause was missing on EntityFind.one() calls
- Fixed issues with ResourceReference directory listings where filenames
  have spaces in them
- Fixed bug in service parameter text-length.@max checking
- Fixed bug where a cached one query on non-PK fields with no result would
  not be automatically cleared
- Fixed bug where request to a rile resource under a screen that requires
  authc would result in a redirect to the file resource
- Fixed bug in UrlResourceReference with cached exists not picking up
  created files; now only uses cached exists if it is true
- Fixed handling of transition actions (or service-call) output where a Map
  was pushed on the ContextStack and then popped, eliminating the output
  from the actions
- Fixed object formatting in XML Screen/Form output, now done in a groovy
  method instead of with ?string in FTL which produced undesirable results
  in many scenarios

===========================================================================
Release 1.1.1 - 22 Sep 2012
===========================================================================

The 1.1.1 release of Moqui Framework is primarily a bug fix release. While
a few issues have been fixed the most important one for those just trying
Moqui is the explicit sorting of files by name during data loading which
addresses an issue on Linux servers where the files in a directory listing
through the Java File API can come back in any order.

Minor new features include DB configured User Fields on entities, host name
based tenant selection, and an easier way to specify default themes.

This release includes:

- User Field support for transparent user-defined fields with a definition
  in the database (using the UserField entity) and values for the fields
  isolated to groups of users stored in a separate table (using the
  UserFieldValue entity)
- Option to specify a default tenantId for a given host name
  (request.getServerName()) in the database, using the TenantHostDefault
  entity for deployment of tenants with a virtual host approach
- Can now specify the default screenThemeId for a ScreenThemeType
  Enumeration record using the Enumeration.enumCode field

Bug Fixes:

- fixed data file load order to explicitly sort files in data directories
  alpha-numerically; on some systems this is the way they came back in
  directory listings but not all, causing inconsistent behavior without
  this explicit sorting (symptom is FK errors in data load)
- fixed incorrect link paths for ArtifactHitBins and ArtifactSummary PDFs
- when no transaction is in place using current system time for the
  automatically populated lastUpdateStamp field
- changed SpeedTest.xml screen to run in a transaction
- fixed issue in Auto Screens where the entityName and detailEntityName
  parameters were conflicting with field names on certain entities
- fixed class cast exception for form-list when using the
  auto-fields-entity element with @field-type=find-display
- fixed and improved screen menu title defaults, especially for subscreens
  added by subdirectory files
- fixed issue with isPermitted() call when determining if screens with
  require-authentication=false should be included in the menu; they were
  showing an error and not getting added to the menu but now they do get
  added because no authz is necessary to access them

===========================================================================
Release 1.1.0 - 22 July 2012
===========================================================================

Version 1.1.0 includes various bug fixes and library updates. It is also a
minor new feature release with added functionality for anonymous authz,
enhanced JSON and REST web service support, XML Form extension with
database records (DbForm* entities) for all users or particular users, and
an Apache Camel integration with Camel running embedded.

This version also replaces the only LGPL library (Restone XML-RPC) in Moqui
Framework with an Apache licensed library (Apache XML-RPC). This makes
Moqui compatible with licensing requirements for projects that are part of
the Apache Software Foundation (including Apache OFBiz).

This release includes:

- Updated *.gradle build files for the recently released Gradle 1.0
- Added configuration for MS SQL Server database
- Replaced Redstone XML-RPC library with Apache XML-RPC to eliminate the
  LGPL library so that Moqui can be used in Apache and similarly licensed
  projects (including Apache OFBiz)
- Updated Apache Derby to 10.8.2.2, Apache Jackrabbit to 2.4.1, Apache
  Log4J to 1.2.17, Apache Shiro to 1.2.0, Atomikos to 3.8.0, ehcache to
  2.5.2, FreeMarker to 2.3.19, Groovy to 2.0.0, Quartz Scheduler to
  2.1.5, SLF4J to 1.6.5
- Updated jQuery to 1.7.2, jQuery UI to 1.8.21, Validate to 1.9.0, and
  Timepicker to 1.0.0
- Tested with latest version of Apache Tomcat (7.0.27)
- Methods on ArtifactExecutionFacade and options on the authenticate
  attribute on the service definition and the require-authentication on the
  screen definition to make the current artifact anonymously authorized
- Web Facade
  - JSON representation of a Map sent in an HTTP Request body is treated as
    additional request parameters (must have a header of "Content-Type:
    application/json")
  - If auth* parameters are passed in a JSON body, multi-part body
    parameters, or in body parameters when there are no URL parameters
    (query string), then automatically logs in user (similar to behavior of
    HTTP Basic Authorization with the Authorization header)
  - Based on the various new features for REST, JSON, and better support of
    Web standards, added examples of the use of screen transitions for JSON
    over REST services; see the ExampleApp.xml file
- Screen Facade
  - Added support for declared path-parameters in the URL path under a
    transition (especially useful for simulating a resource at a URL)
  - Implemented initial version of DbForm feature with support for
    extending forms defined in XML Screen files; includes example extending
    the UpdateExample form on the EditExample screen; for details see the
    DbForm and related entities, and the example in the ExampleTypeData.xml
- Service Facade
  - Embedded Apache Camel, currently used in the ServiceFacade to transport
    service calls using many different standards, plus Camel routing for
    more flexible system integration
  - CamelServiceRunner so that Moqui services can just send a Camel message
  - Camel component, endpoint, and producer for receiving Moqui service
    calls through camel (with URI like "moquiservice:package.serviceName")
  - Example Moqui service that sends a Camel message, and example service
    that service calls through the Moqui Camel Endpoint (Producer)
  - Support for nested parameter elements in service definitions for
    Map and Node (groovy.util.Node) parameters; the main reason for Node
    support is for XML messages coming in such as the OAGIS ones to be
    handled directly by a service (this is one part of Mantle)
  - Added option to service-call tag to send result as a JSON response
    using the WebFacade.sendJsonResponse() method
  - Service database-driven semaphores to avoid multiple instances of the
    same service running at the same time
- Entity Facade
  - View entity member-entity.entity-condition for conditions on joins
  - View entity alias.complex-alias implemented for formulas in queries
  - Added "cursor" option for the database.@offset-style attribute for
    databases that do not support the offset/limit or fetch syntax
    variations; using this option will result in an EntityListIterator
    being used instead of letting the database handle the partial results
  - Added EntityDatasourceFactory interface and object-factory attribute
    to the entity-facade.datasource element in the moqui-conf XML file;
    the default implementation is for JDBC/SQL databases, and other
    implementations can be used for other data sources
  - Refactored EntityValueImpl and EntityFindImpl to create abstract base
    classes that can be extended to more easily create custom datasource
    interfaces for the Entity Facade
  - There is an add-on component that uses this custom datasource facility
    to add support for OrientDB, and other NoSQL and alternative
    datasource interfaces will be added as add-ons over time

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed bug in script template for XML Actions calling a script at a
  location (was missing quotes around the location)
- Fixed bug where XML Actions and groovy script locations were not being
  cleaned before using as class names for groovy compiled classes
- Fixed Entity Audit Log bug where fields not set were considered null and
  therefore were considered changed to null and logged as such
- Fixed NPE when calling update() on an EntityValueImpl with no changes
- Fixed NPE when there is an error in a request and the web.parameters,
  web.requestAttributes, and web.requestParameters have not been used
- Fixed authz issue when calling service with auth* parameters
  (UserAccount, Username, Password, and TenantId) so that login is done
  before the first authz check to avoid guaranteed failure
- Fixed WebFacade.sendJsonResponse() to return ec.messages.errors if there
  are errors instead of ignoring them
- Fixed issue in L10nFacadeImpl (also used for service parameter automatic
  type conversions) where Time and Timestamp parsing required sub-second
  value; now parses strings without sub-seconds as well
- Fixed bug where service definition was not found if it had no noun
  attribute even if service name matched the verb
- Fixed invalid HTML with a form elements between the table and td elements
  by using styled div elements and the "display: table*" CSS attributes

===========================================================================
Release 1.0.1 - 31 December 2011
===========================================================================

Version 1.0.1 is primarily a maintenance and bug fix release. The few new
features are mostly extensions to existing features for improved
flexibility, to round out functionality, and better support standards.

This release includes:

- All the great features of the 1.0.0 and previous releases
- Updated Gradle build file for version 1.0-milestone-6 (previously ran on
  1.0-milestone-3)
- Added support to automatically clear caches for view-entity based in
  updates to member-entity records, as long as all member-entity PK fields
  are directly or indirectly aliased on the view-entity
- Improved entity-auto service error handling
- Changed login screen to render in the same request instead of a redirect
  and to return a status code of 401 (related to bug #3442045)
- Made form field sub-fields more flexible, can include any widget tag
  under them now; this has been tested with render-mode and should work
  with others as they just run the corresponding macro for the widget
  element, but your mileage may vary
- Added support for a classes directory under the runtime directory, and
  under each component directory to go along with the lib directories so
  that classpath resources do not have to be in a jar file
- Added support for JSR-223 (javax.script) compatible scripting languages
  through configuration only (in moqui-conf file) so no ScriptRunner
  interface implementation is needed for these
- Added support for JavaScript (.js) server-side scripts through
  javax.script interface
- Added support for StartTLS and SSL to sendEmailTemplate service, based
  on the configuration in the EmailServer record

Bug Fixes:

- Removed emailTypeEnumId from the PK of the EmailMessage entity, it
  should not have been there and is not needed (or wanted); this PK
  change will require modifying or rebuilding that table in existing
  systems
- Fixed issue with handling entities in different packages that have the
  same name
- Instead of submit buttons always having name=submit, they now use the
  name of the XML Form field; to see if one button or another was pressed
  just check to see if the parameter was passed; also changed all submit
  field names to submitButton to avoid conflict with standard DOM function
  "submit" for form elements (thanks to Vasanth for reporting this)
- Fixed bad reference to ComparisonOperator in DateCondition class
- Fixed issue with settings nulls in an entity-auto update service or
  anywhere the dbValueMap is not populated from the database
- Fixed bug (#3442014) with funny FTL eval of label.@encode attribute
- Fixed issue with ResourceFacade classpath:// URLs that were not using
  thread's context ClassLoader, and so weren't finding classpath entries
  in runtime or component lib and classes directories
- Fixed issue with ResourceReference, TemplateRenderer, ScriptRunner,
  ServiceRunner, and Java service implementation class loading to use the
  current Thread's context ClassLoader which will get the component and
  runtime lib and classes resources
- Fixed issue where automatic reverse relationship did not work for full
  entity names
- Fixed issue with findRelated and findRelatedOne when forUpdate is null
- Fixed bug in StupidUtilities.basicConvert so that String to Boolean
  conversions do not use the default groovy non-empty rule for true, ie
  so that the string "false" will actually evaluate to false
- Fixed service parameters validation to not treat false boolean values as
  empty values (ie we can't use groovy non-empty definition for Booleans)
- Fixed permission issue in resetPassword service


===========================================================================
Release 1.0.0 - 21 November 2011
===========================================================================

Here it is, the initial production release of the 1.0 series. This release
includes various fixes and new features to facilitate easy use based on
more extensive testing and real-world development using the framework.

More examples of different patterns exist in Moqui Framework itself, as
well as in add-on projects including Mantle, POP Commerce, and so on.

This release includes:

- All the great features of the preview, beta and rc1 releases
- For field name pattern consistency changed GeoAssoc.geoIdTo to toGeoId,
  StatusValidChange.statusIdTo to toStatusId, and UomConversion.uomIdTo to
  toUomId
- Added support to skip stats tracking based on a conditional expression
- More performance profiling and improvements
  - entity-auto update and delete services no longer do a find first
  - various frequently used objects are cached in UserFacade, especially
    those used for authz and tarpit, making many things faster and cached
    queries around 4 times faster than the already optimized speed
  - many small performance improvements, changes to get around Groovy and
    Java quirks
- Change components to load in reverse of order initialized (later
  components override earlier ones)
- Increased text field sizes (short to 63, medium to 255, long to 4095)
- Changed a bunch of fields from text-long to text-medium that are either
  primary-key fields, or that don't need to be so long, or in entities
  where there are too many text-long fields
- User Facade
  - Added support for login via HTTP Basic Authorization, mostly for
    things like RESTful services and support for clients using it
- Entity Facade
  - Allow (optional) reference of entity by package-name + entity-name,
  - Change framework to reference all its entities by fully qualified name
  - Allow separator (hash) between title and related-entity-name in
    relationship name now that related-entity-name may be packages and
    such, and looks funny
  - Primary sequenced ID banking for better performance when creating
    records with sequenced single field primary key (default bank size 50)
  - Change lastUpdatedStamp to tx timestamp to sync/export/etc data without
    splitting transactions
  - Supports seed-data element in entity and extend-entity elements so
    that seed data can be defined and managed along with entity definitions
  - Option to disable Entity ECAs during data load
  - Isolate cache clearing failures, don't ever kill calling method (ie
    never throw an exception/throwable)
- Screen Facade
  - Filter menu rendering by authorization
  - List multi form submit button below and not in own column
  - Allow field, auto-fields-entity, and auto-fields-service to appear in
    any order and preserve that order when exploding the form definition
  - Auto Screen move Edit button on list forms to left side
  - If form transition has a single service (service-call instead of
    actions elements) then automatically use that service for validation
    information for fields with matching name
  - Improved handling of context and error parameters to more cleanly and
    easily repopulate forms after a server-side error
  - Example (/echopath) of handling "path info" beyond screen or transition
    in request path
- Added support for other types of wiki files including MediaWiki, Textile,
  TracWiki, and TWiki (in addition to Confluence)

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-rc1 - 3 August 2011
===========================================================================

The first 1.0 release candidate of the Moqui Framework (version 1.0-rc1)
was released on 3 August 2011.

This release includes various small new features based on feedback and
actual use, including Apache Shiro for security (authc and authz), build
using Gradle which supports Maven repositories and with directory layout
changed to follow Maven conventions, the ability to run arbitrary SQL and
get the results back in an EntityListIterator, and the Data View tool that
allows users to build queries and data exports on the fly.

This release candidate also includes improvements based on more testing,
including performance testing and profiling to dramatically increase the
speed of various operations, especially those done frequently.

As a release candidate from this point only minor changes are expected
before the 1.0 final production-ready release.

This release includes:

- All the great features of the preview releases, 1.0-beta1, and 1.0-beta2
- More testing and bug fixes
- Various performance improvements based on profiling (thanks to preview
  licenses for YourKit and JProfiler)
- Updated all libraries with updates available as of 15 July 2011
- Changed build to use Gradle instead of Ant
- Support for multiple root screens determined by host name using regexp,
  or in other words virtual host support
- UserPreference records refined so that keys can be defined with
  Enumeration records, but don't have to be
- Some changes to better support the Mantle UDM (Universal Data Model),
  including better automatic foreign key names, looking for a "mantle"
  directory under the runtime directory where the mantle components can go
  (can actually have the GIT checkout of mantle right there)
- Added a UserGroup (ALL_USERS) that all users are automatically members of
- Security: tightened permissions, using the entity.@authorize-skip much
  less by adding disable/enableAuthz calls to framework code, and adding an
  authorization for users to view their own UserAccount record.
- Directory structure and build changes to simplify and be more consistent
  with de-facto standards from Maven/Gradle/etc
- Small changes to make it easier to include the runtime directory inside
  the deployed war file.
- Resource Facade
  - Added ScriptRunner interface to allow for easily adding scripting
    languages to be supported by the ResourceFacade
- User Facade
  - Incorporated Apache Shiro, which is now used for all authentication in
    Moqui, by default through the MoquiShiroRealm and other realms such
    as for LDAP or ActiveDirectory can be configured with shiro.ini
  - Permission model and checking for simple/flat permissions (to be used
    as an alternative to artifact authz)
  - Run permission and role (UserGroup) checks through Shiro realm
- Entity Facade
  - Manual SQL find with results mapped to entity with results returned in

Release 1.0-beta2 - 30 May 2011
===========================================================================

The 1.0-beta2 release includes a number of new tools, most notably the Auto
Screen UI that creates a user interface based on entity and relationship
definitions for master entities, and tabs for the detail and associated
entities of each. This release also includes a number of smaller new
features and bug fixes found while building a variety of functionality
with Moqui Framework. One notable example of that is automatic or explicit
alternate screen selection based on the HTTP request User-Agent header, and
there is an example of alternate screens for the iPad.

Overall release 1.0-beta2 is more robust, functional, and reliable than the
previous release.

This release includes:

- All the great features of releases 1.0-preview1 to 1.0-beta1
- Changed so that web.requestParameters Map is automatically added to the
  context when it is initialized for the web (helps reduce dependency in
  code on web-specific stuff, ie ec.web.requestParameter references)
- L10nFacade: moved number and date/time parsing and formatting methods
  from UserFacade to L10nFacade
- TransactionFacade: changed suspend() and resume() methods to better use
  internal stack of suspended transactions for consistency and a simpler
  API; also added stack of Exception to track where transactions are
  suspended for easier finding of lock wait timeout types of errors
- Moved MoquiDefaultConf.xml from framework/api to framework/impl since it
  contains a lot of implementation-specific configuration
- Updated Atomikos TransactionsEssentials to 3.7.0 and ehcache to 2.4.1
- Support <component>/lib and runtime/lib jar loading in a cached and
  extended/extensible ClassLoader
- Screen transition now supports restriction by HTTP request method
- Trim stack traces to not include Groovy proxy/etc calls (Sam's idea);
  implemented for now in BaseException, will use in other areas over time
- Changed Example entities and seed data to follow pattern to be used in
  Moqui and Mantle where the relationship.title is the enumTypeId or the
  statusTypeId
- XML Screens
  - Dynamic transition name handling (support regex transition names)
  - Specify macro template in screen def to override default in moqui-conf
  - Template for xsl-fo render mode
  - Added support for drop-down.entity-options in Screen Form
  - Auto create drop-downs for fields with a relationship to Enumeration
    using relationship.title as the enumTypeId, check to see if is valid
    enumTypeId before creating drop-down
  - Auto create drop-downs for fields with a type one relationship, with
    limit of 200 to avoid crazy drop-downs
  - Choose default subscreen (override by path) based on user agent or
    other condition (using any data available in the ec)
  - Override login path in screen (use value from deepest screen in path)
- Resource Facade
  - Method for FOP transform to PDF, etc
  - Support .gstring templates (groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Templates)
- Entity Facade
  - More intelligent group by fields, ie add all fields in view-entity and
    DynamicViewEntity to group by list if they don't have a function; with
    support for this get rid of alias.@group-by attribute, not needed when
    done automatically
  - Entity Master data export (master record and all dependent records)
  - Entity and Dependents export: if an entity is a dependent of another,
    and of the master then export it after the other entity it is a
    dependent of
- Tools Screens
  - Auto Screen
    - Master Entity List (entities with dependents)
    - AutoFind Screen (find, create, delete master entity records)
    - AutoEditMaster (tab to edit master entity record)
    - AutoEditDetail (tab for each dependent entity with CrUD)
  - Entity
    - Entity Data UI
      - entity list
      - find on entity with delete
      - create/update entity record
      - view entity record with related entities and links to them
    - Entity Data Import screen
    - Entity Data Export screen


===========================================================================
Release 1.0-beta1 - 01 Apr 2011
===========================================================================

The 1.0-beta1 release is the first feature-complete release for the 1.0
series. Various tools screens that may be included in the 1.0-final release
are not yet complete, but the framework itself is feature-complete.
Following this release the focus for the framework shifts from
implementation to testing and to building applications and tools based on
it (in Moqui Framework, Moqui Mantle, and in other Moqui-based projects).

This release includes:

- All the great features of releases 1.0-preview1 to 1.0-preview3
- Changed UserAccount so that userId is internal/sequenced and a new
  username field is used for auth/login
- Seed data changes to follow the Mantle pattern where enumTypeId is the
  same as entity.relationship.@title for Enumerations
- XML Screens
  - Screen form-list form-list-column support
  - Screen form-single field-layout support
  - Screen form-list pagination (defaults in search-form-inputs)
  - Template for csv render mode (mainly for form-list report-like output)
  - Template for text render mode (for email alternative message, etc)
  - Template for xml render mode (like CSV, but more structured and
    support multiple forms per screen)
  - Support URL parameters for renderMode and pageNoLimit which along with
    the lastStandalone parameter make it easy to reuse screens and forms
    meant for user interaction as definitions for CSV output
- WebApp event actions for after-startup, before-shutdown
- Service Facade
  - Incoming email handling with Email ECA Rules (emeca) with the
    org.moqui.impl.EmailServices.pollEmailServer service, configured with
    the EmailServer entity
  - Service (org.moqui.impl.EmailServices.sendEmailTemplate) to send email
    based on settings in the EmailTemplate entity
- Entity Facade
  - Automatic reverse-many relationship for type one relationships coming
    the other way (done on-demand at run-time)
- Password reset email and forgot password form
- Some fixes so that Moqui will run in Java on Windows
- Testing and fixes for EntityFindImpl.count();
  screen.transition.*-response parameters; screen.transition with no
  actions or conditional responses to act as an alias, even with
  parameters/etc; script type services; updatePassword service and various
  security/password settings

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-preview3 - 19 Mar 2011
===========================================================================

Moqui 1.0-preview3 introduces various features to automatically and easily
make the applications you build using the previously available tools easier
to deploy and administer, and easier to test and get information about what
is happening as artifacts are executed. These include multi-tenant support,
artifact hit and hit bin tracking (for screens, transitions, services, and
entities), database-driven artifact authorization with many advanced
options, XML-RPC and JSON-RPC calls for Moqui services, and Tools screens
to administer and get information about various parts of the framework.

NOTE: just before this release the official code repository for Moqui moved
from SourceForge SVN to Git on GitHub so that users can more easily create
Git forks for their own use, and to allows pulls from their Git forks back
into the main Moqui repository. The Moqui GitHub URL is:

https://github.com/jonesde/moqui

This release includes:

- All of the great features of 1.0-preview1 and 1.0-preview2
- Updated various libraries included (esp Groovy, ehCache, Quartz)
- Multi-tenant support (shared app server, separate databases)
- Finished impl and test for localized messages and entity fields
- WebApp event actions for first-hit-in-visit, before-request,
  after-request, after-login, before-logout
- JSON-RPC 2.0 incoming service handler (with Dzhuvinov JSON-RPC)
- JSON-RPC 2.0 outgoing service runner (with Dzhuvinov JSON-RPC)
- XML-RPC incoming service handler (with Redstone XML-RPC)
- XML-RPC outgoing service runner (with Redstone XML-RPC)
- XML Screens
  - Screen form client JS validation based on target transition service
    definition (define once, run on client and server); using jquery
    validation (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation); so far for
    required, number-integer, number-decimal, text-email, text-url,
    text-digits, credit-card; try out on the Edit Example screen
  - Screen form-list multi=false support (one form per row)
  - Screen form-list multi=true support, service call multi=true
  - Screen form-list support form-links inside main form
  - Screen form auto-complete for text-line
  - Screen subscreen menu dynamic tabs (last level only) that loads
    content as a standalone screen from the server with an ajax call
  - Screen form focus-field, skip-start and skip-end supported
- Visitor tracking
- ArtifactHit and ArtifactHitBin tracking for screen, screen-content,
  transition, service and entity (bin only)
- User preference handling
- Artifact Execution Facade
  - ArtifactExecutionFacade for artifact stack tracking
  - Artifact Authorization based on configuration in db
  - Call ArtifactExecutionFacade.push(aei) (to track, check authz, etc) for
    screen, transition, service, entity
  - Disable authz on data loading; command line and assumed to be safe
  - Handle direct service/entity calls, ArtifactGroupMember with pattern
  - Review and test to determine which entities can skip authz for view
    and create (ie some view only, some create only, some view and create)
  - For entity-implicit service calls just look for entity authz
  - Support authorization on subscreens even if no authz on parent
    screens, ie authz for EditExample even though not for ExampleApp or
    any other screens in that app
  - Record-level authorization (ArtifactAuthzRecord/Cond)
  - Authorization with a service (ArtifactAuthzService)
- Tools Screens
  - Artifact Hit Bins
  - Audit Log
  - Visit and Hit Info/Stats (Find Visits, Visit details with hit list)
  - Cache List and Elements
  - Localization: Messages, Entity Fields
- Simplified sequenced ID API for both primary and secondary sequenced IDs
  and moved configuration to entity definition, and methods to EntityValue
- Cleanups for xml-actions elements: from-field to from, call-service to
  service-call, call-script to script; better now than later to make the
  XML a bit cleaner and more clear (for example from-field can be any
  groovy expression and the -field implies otherwise)
- Significantly more testing and bug fixes related to synchronization,
  performance (WAY faster, but more room for improvement), transactions,
  style, etc

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-preview2 - 01 Mar 2011
===========================================================================

With release 1.0-preview2 the Moqui Framework is now nearly complete and
has sufficient functionality to build a wide variety of functional and
useful enterprise, or less formal, applications. This release includes a
functional example application with various screens demonstrating features
of the framework and recommended practices and patterns to use when
developing with Moqui.

While not feature-complete for the planned 1.0 feature set, the
1.0-preview2 release is ready for early adopters. For those interested,
this is a great time to try out Moqui for a pet project or even a more
formal project that is just getting started and won't be deployed in
production for at least a few months.

Feedback on functionality and bugs by early adopters would be extremely
helpful for the project at this point, both to validate (or invalidate...)
designs and to more extensively test the implementation.

This release includes:

- All of the great features of 1.0-preview1
- Significant updates to Example application screens (most now working)
- Added various configuration options and examples for flexible deployment
  and overriding templates for screen macros, xml-actions, etc
- Executable WAR file is more self-contained, ie less required in runtime
  but with a few more override options in runtime too
- Root web screen split to support undecorated subscreens and apps

- XML Screens
  - Screen form elements, all implemented (including file upload, *-find)
  - Standalone screens that are rendered independently of parent screens
    and can still be subscreens of any other screen
  - Screen pre-actions that all run before any parent screen is rendered
    to allow for setting parameters in parent screens, setting up general
    things, etc
  - Screen single-form HTML uses fieldset and label instead of a table
  - Screen form header-field widget rendering
  - Screen form header-field.@show-order-by support
  - Screen form localized output formatting, based on service parameter
    format if applicable, otherwise on format specified in form field
  - Output encoding, configurable on various screen/form elements
  - I18n (with L10nFacade) for labels and titles in screens, forms, menus
  - Added jquery and jquery-ui and the smoothness theme
  - Added container-dialog widget that creates a button that when clicked
    on opens a dialog with the contents of the container-dialog.
  - Added datetimepicker, which is the standard jquery datepicker plus the
    timepicker add-on, combined using some code from Apache OFBiz
  - Extended and now using database-driven screen visual themes
  - Can send Maps to HTTP response as JSON string (Web Facade), example of
    this is in EditExample.xml
- Service Facade
  - Service expand auto-parameters, get parameters from implements
  - Finished implementation of async/scheduled service calls
  - Service run on commit and on rollback of current tx
  - Service parameter type/subtype checking
  - Service parameter ESAPI/Antisamy HTML checks (any/safe/none)
  - Service authentication
  - Service parameter conversion/parsing and validation checks
  - Service ECA rules
- Entity Facade
  - View-entity fixes and testing, now most view-entity options work
  - Support entity-find.search-form-inputs element for form *-find fields
  - Automatic cache clearing for one, list (using RA cache), count caches
  - Entity extension
  - Entity audit-logging
  - Entity field encryption
  - Entity ECA rules
  - Support offset and limit as LIMIT/OFFSET or OFFSET/FETCH depending on
    configuration on the database element in the Moqui conf file
  - Database meta-data support for adding indexes when tables added
  - Automatically add columns if missing in table check
  - Add foreign keys to existing tables when table created
  - Added EntityDbMeta.createForeignKeysForExistingTables() to check the
    foreign keys of all entities with existing tables and add missing ones
    where both tables exist; useful to run once all desired tables have
    been created (through a data load, test script, etc) to round out the
    DB meta-data

- Interesting JS plugins
  - http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
  - http://www.datatables.net
  - http://www.datatables.net/examples/data_sources/server_side.html
  - http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-editable/
  - http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/autosuggest-jquery-plugin

- User Notification
  - WebSocket clients: track userId, notificationName, connectionKey
    - Entity (no, keep in memory): VisitClient - visitId*, userId*, topic*, connectionKey*
    - when sending out WebSocket messages lookup all active Visits for userId and send to each connectionKey
    - API (with at least an example transition) for WebSocket client registry; set connectionKey on current Visit
    - use Camel WebSocket? jWebSocket? (how to send message to client connection key)
    - after more research candidates are (no jWebSocket because it is huge and messy):
      * java_websocket: smallest (90k), no dependencies on other libraries (like Tomcat or Jetty WS), very simple
        library so no authc, no pubsub; has JS library for JS client and Flash SWF file for browsers with no WebSocket
      - Atmosphere: med size (460k), supports variety of transports, but no internal WebSocket (relies on Tomcat, Jetty,
        etc websocket impls), has pubsub model and sessions built-in, but questionable authc facility
  x Manual notification:
    x API pass in notificationName, Map message, userGroupId, boolean queue (true: queue if not connected, false: only send if connected)
    x API to get all outstanding notifications
    x Entity: NotificationMessage - notificationMessageId*, topic, userGroupId, messageJson (from message Map)
    x Entity: NotificationMessageUser - notificationMessageId*, userId*, sentDate, receivedDate
  - Add Moqui Conf XML elements to configure NotificationMessageListener classes
  - Listener for Email with XML Screen to layout (and try out using JSON documents as nested Maps from a screen)
    - where to configure the email and screen to use? use EmailTemplate/emailTemplateId, but where to specify?
      - for notifications from DataFeeds can add DataFeed.emailTemplateId (or not, what about toAddresses, etc?)
      - maybe have a more general way to configure details of topics, including emailTemplateId and screenLocation...

- Data Document and Feed
  - API (or service?) push outstanding data changes (registration/connection, time trigger; tie to SystemMessage)
  - API (or service?) receive/persist data change messages - going reverse of generation for DataDocuments... should be interesting
  - Consumer System Registry
    - feed transport (for each: supports confirmation?)
      - WebSocket (use Notification system, based on notificationName (and userId?))
  - Service to send email from DataFeed (ie receive#DataFeed implementation), use XML Screen for email content
    - don't do this directly, do through NotificationMessage, ie the next item... or maybe not, too many parameters for
      email from too many places related to a DataDocument, may not be flexible enough and may be quite messy
  - Service (receive#DataFeed impl) to send documents as User NotificationMessages (one message per DataDocument); this
    is probably the best way to tie a feed to WebSocket notifications for data updates
    - Use the dataFeedId as the NotificationMessage topic
    - Use this in HiveMind to send notifications of project, task, and wiki changes (maybe?)
