            Triggered by service calls with various options about when during the service call to trigger the event.
            If condition (optional) evaluates to true then the actions are run.

            Service ECAs are meant for triggering business processes and for extending the functionality of existing
            services that you don't want to, or can't, modify.
            Service ECAs should NOT generally be used for maintenance of data derived from other entities, Entity ECA
            rules are a much better tool for that.

            When this runs the context will be whatever context the service was run in, plus the individual parameters
            for convenience in reading the values.
            If when is before the service itself is run there will be a context variable called "parameters" with the
            parameters Map in it that you can modify as needed in the actions. If when is after the service itself
            the "parameters" variable will contain the parameters and a "results" parameter will contain the results
            that also may be modified.
